    "\n",
    "En este laboratorio, tabrajaras con datos de reseñas de productos para construir un sistema de recomendación que utilice procesamiento de lenguaje natural (NLP) y *machine learning*. El objetivo principal es que analices el contenido textual de las reseñas, clasifiques las opiniones en categorías (positiva, negativa o neutra) y aproveches esta información para personalizar las recomendaciones. El sistema priorizará los productos con mejores reseñas para usuarios específicos y permitirá evaluar si el análisis de sentimientos mejora la calidad de las recomendaciones. Tareas propuestas:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caso 1: Crear un sistema de recomendación**: Debes generar un sistema de recomendación para priorizar productos con las reseñas para cada usuario. Los pasos que deberás seguir son:    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Estructurar el conjunto de datos\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sistema basado en contenido\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caso 2: Clasificar reseñas en positivas, negativas o neutras** Deberás implementar un modelo para analizar las reseñas textuales y clasificarlas en tres categorías:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Positivas: Si el sentimiento de la reseña es favorable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Negativas: Si el sentimiento de la reseña es desfavorable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neutras: Si la reseña no tiene un sentimiento claro.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- Pasos :\n",
    "\t- Preprocesamiento de texto: Limpiar las reseñas eliminando caracteres especiales, palabras vacías (stopwords) y realizar lematización.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t- Identificar las reseñas positivas, negativas y neutrales. \n",

       "      <td>I’ll admit I was very skeptical from reviews but I decided to purchase anyways…. and so far so good! Battery life is about 7 hours of constant use (games, videos, etc). Sounds is good. I had no problems connecting to internet. The border of the phone did appear to have some scratches but not too many., The phone I received has a loose charging port that should have been replaced. It was at 27% just now and I plugged it in and opened an app. Now it just gave me the under 20% notification so it’s obviously struggling to keep the cord in place., No working well can't download any apps horrible phone My old Android works better than this junk. Please refund money. Diana Manuele, It’s for personal and the battery life issues is crazy it’s only take 2 hours, Worked slow, barely charged., Battery life is not good at all. Only last an hour., The worse I never bought. Battery is dead and I sent it in Africa, so no way to return it. Just lost my money. I could give 0 star, I’m very picky with my phone cases which means I keep buying them until I find one that’s jut right. This phone case has everything I’m looking for. It’s not to bulky and has a slim fit. It’s enclosed and has a built in screen protector. The front plastic trim doesn’t cover top and bottom front of the Like some cases making the screen “appear” smaller.The rubber is stiff and durable and not like those cheap ones the stretch out over time.One reviewer stated they had to keep taking it apart to get the moister out. Well this is NOT a waterproof case and if it was it would be heavier and bulkier. I’m wondering how that much moister is getting in ther in the 1st place. Are you bathing with it? Tip: instead of drenching the phone with cleaning solution then wiping it up, try spraying the cleaning solution on the rag itself (just enough to coat it) then use that to clean the screen.Another reviewer stated the back falls off. If you don’t snap it in correctly this will happen. Solution: go to an arts and crafts store or fabric store and ask for some double sided hem tape. It’s very thin and extremely strong. It will keep that back on if it’s a defect., Phone broke a little after a month. Was only given a small % back on return and was never told why after multiple emails. Do not buy!!!!, Phone appeared to be flawless when it arrived. It stopped recognizing any sim card after 3 months. even though it was a few days out of warranty when it died the seller still took it back for a full refund., Too small in size, The phone looks great. However, the battery life was 70% instead of the promised 80%. This means that the battery dies very quickly, even when fully charged. We attempted to contact the seller but received no response. We would have settled for an exchange, but again, no response. Looks like we have to buy a battery, add another $50 to the price to get a fully refurbished phone. Very disappointed., Hey- it’s an iPhone. I did have to buy ear buds for this unit as none came with it.The phone is OK, but the battery is horrible., GSM does not work. This version of IPhone cannot be repaired. I stop being able to update, because it does not connect to the local network. It is WITHOUT SERVICE ... that is, now it helps me to connect only by wifi and to listen to music ... Battery drains from 100 to 0 in 2 hours of use  The battery is at 50%? I mean, impossible to use it. Lousy purchase They should withdraw it from circulation to these iPhone 7, Phone came in on 86 battery life and touch screen doesn’t like to work, wouldn’t recommend this phone., phone works great, but battery needs replacement, per the iPhone settings screen, just over 3 months after purchase. Does not hold charge for long even with all settings optimized, not using GPS in background etc. Otherwise price was reasonable., The phone battery was supposed to be at 80% or better but this battery only 77% and Apple saying need to replace battery now. It's too bad vendors don't install new batteries and increase the price because changing these batteries is not fun as you can have screen damage and broken wires. Aside from that very happy with phone and fast delivery., Good condition, but instantly overheats when charge. Not sure if that’s normal but the body of it great condition, This IPhone 7 gets really hot as soon as you charge it . Also it charges slow ,, The phone is unlocked no scratches , no flaws . Came right on clear. Packaged for fragile item very well. My daughter loves her new phone., It is hard to buy from a third party and it not working is frustrating., My review is half bad and half good. It came in almost a week, which I was crazy waiting for it. I was so happy when it got here! I checked the battery capacity and it only charges to 62, which was so disappointing. It charges really fast, but loses a lot of percent quick. Other than that everything was good. It came with a charger and charger block., I ordered from Trademore to get a refurbished iPhone 7, and it arrived fully ready to go out of the box with the latest iOS version installed. All I needed to do was add in my SIM chip and sign on with my Apple ID, and iCloud Backup restore did the rest. The unit I received works like new and was actually flat (as opposed to some other refurbs I've had); it had some scratching on the glass, but not over the actual display area. Trademore and Amazon refurbs may seemed more expensive than refurbs from elsewhere, but it's worth it for a great unit with no hassles or technical gotchas., It took a while for this to become an issue. At first I was restarting the phone which I thought was fixing the problem but the proximity sensor does not function properly. As a result, when I attempt to talk on a call, the screen remains lit and the side of my face continually hits the buttons, resulting in frustration for both me and the caller. It's impossible to hold a voice call at this point. Unfortunately, by the time I realized what the problem is, the phone isn't eligible for a refund., Easy to use, I got my iphone 7 opened it was fine owner didnt factor reset it i turned it on an it was on home screen.Works well i like it!! 8/10 😃, batter health was at 70 not the promised 80., Bad phones you are not honest, I bought this for a July gift.  It stopped working 8 months later.  It would no longer receive a cellular signal.  It took about a week to troubleshoot with the mobile carrier before they said it must be your phone.  I took it to a phone repair shop and they said the motherboard crashed. 😩, So I got this phone, when it originally came, it had more damage than what was listed so I returned it. The next one that came in had little to no damage so I was excited. However, after the 30 day return window (of course) the phone has been having all sorts of problems. I have audio issues with my phone on speaker, the keyboard gets stuck constantly, and the battery life is pretty much non-existent. Incredibly pissed I bought this for 230$ and now can only get 60$ if I sell it back. Just a warning, but if you buy your phone from here you are gambling with your money honestly. So just do a payment plan through your provider or get it from apple and spare yourself the frustration, Died every 20 minutes and constantly shut off and if it was colder than 50 degrees it would not turn on., I’m disappointed with this phone’s battery life. I have to make sure I keep a charger with me everywhere I go. This is my first experience with an iPhone so maybe that is how they are, I don’t know., This was in good condition and battery life good., Seller guarantees 80% battery. Received phone with battery capacity of only 75%. Seller never replied to follow up messages and only offered a $20 credit and never replied when alternatives were requested., Bought this refurbished iPhone for our daughter.  We like the parental controls that Apple offers.  We aren't going to buy her a new expensive phone so it is nice to get a used one from Amazon., Overall good product! The cameras kind of glitches at times but it overall works. The battery dies very quickly, but it works perfectly fine even without a sim card. Very good product!, I just got this  for my middle school son in time for school to start. It needed charging upon arrival, but the charging cord/plug that came with it did not work. Luckily this  is a replacement phone, and we have other chargers in the house and so were able to get it charged.It's working so far. I can't comment on battery life yet because it's too soon. The phone appeared to be in excellent condition., Overall satisfied with iPhone 7 transaction: the phone arrived in pristine physical condition--I could not find a scratch on it.The battery however had 78% capacity, not the 80% advertised. Not sure it would have made a difference as this phone was for my 12 year old son and in the end I decided to replace the battery (which granted is not for everyone as it's not a 5-minute process - more like an hour and 44 minutes process).Was able to successfully change the battery and all is well. So, net-net was able to get a like-new iPhone 7 for under $200.Recommend this vendor but do know if you are not comfortable swapping in a new battery you'll be charging your phone 2-3 times a day as normal phone usage will deplete the battery quickly., I like everything I don’t dislike nothing, Fine, I like is because it was a easy set up and everything was good on it, i have to go to apple because i got this phone for verizon and it wont let me make calls or texts sooooo basically dont buy it, I was pleasantly surprised after reading a few not-so-good reviews ... but the iphone 7 (Verizon) that I received looked like it was brand new.  It was packaged very nicely in a custom box with a new charging cable and AC converter.  Not a single scratch on it, \"battery health\" was rated at 84% and everything worked perfectly.  Frankly, I can't imagine why someone actually traded this in for a new phone????  But I'm glad they did.  My daughter (currently my Tech Support person) was sweet enough to get me a very nice \"Youmaker\" protector for it ... she knows I'm a bit clumsy.  I've only had this phone for a few weeks but so far so good.  I even use it for visual control (FPV) on a few of my quads/drones ... it is remarkable how well the battery holds up for that video on 10-15 minute flights ... much better than my old iphone.  Very glad I bought this., Runs slow , colabirtation is off and screen glitches, Battery life is insufficient and less than expected., Phone came fast and everything is good but the battery only holds a charge for about an hour when it’s not charging pretty annoyed about this., Bad battery life junk charger, just buy new instead of having to do it anyways, Home button non functional., Wasn't bad came in good condition., If I can fit everything I didn’t like about this phone into this box I would detail it.But whoever replaced the screen did a horrible jobWon’t register any SIM cards to any carrierIt looks like I bought it from wish.com, There’s a black line when trying to take pictures, takes horrible pictures, The phone is used and it doesn’t earphones, Everything was great. Like brand new!, Like many, read a lot of bad reviews... Was worried that there would be major issues upon getting the phone. HOWEVER, my phone showed up next day, SUPER FAST. Opened up the packaging and the iphone 7 looked very very good. Couple very tiny scuffs, but was expecting such as it is a USED phone would give it a 9/10 and i'm picky. Called my phone provider and they were able to switch it to my number no problem. I have sprint, which has merged with t mobile. I got the FULLY UNLOCKED phone, for anyone wondering. After running the phone through all its tests, everything is in proper working order. Battery life is at 84% which is fine by me. Higher than the stated number of 80% anyways. Never really payed attention to that stuff on the other phones i have had. All i can say is that the phone is doing everything it should and I am very happy with it. If there is one concern, the phone may be running a hair warm, but nothing to seem worried about momentarily. I will update this post at any point in the next 6 months if need be, but so far so good. COMPANY I WENT WITH: TECH EXCHANGEE NY, screen had a small crack and a chip  and the back has some marks on it and the home button is difficult to make contact. however the phone does work., Cord does not work!, This device only worked for 6 months and it started decaying. I send it to apple and they stated that it will need a new motherboard., This was for personal use the phone has been nothing but trouble since the day we got it. Will not make calls or will make calls on its own we don’t even when we’re not even trying. Need to know if there is insurance on this purchase Or is there any kind of warranty on this purchase, Item came without a charger, I have been using my phone for about a month, from what I have been able to assess so far the phone has been working properly, the battery holds fairly well, unless playing a game on the phone it drains the battery pretty quickly. The Siri function, the finger print unlock, and camera are pretty amazing, and they are some of the many things that I did not have on my iPhone 4...so this is a wonderful upgrade for me!, Very average product! Must have been used for couple of years before reselling it. Battery life was at 80% when arrived. Good purchase if one wants to buy iPhone at cheap price, Phone works great i have to say no problems so far 5/5, Have this phone just over six months it glitches, turns off all the time, battery drains fast, phone won't shut off even when the battery is at 98%.  The amount of money I spent on it I should have gotten more than 6 months use, wouldn't recommend., The phone  barley work can’t call nobody can’t text nobody, Why it dies so fast ?, It’s ok, It’s a good phone over all but often freezes or hangs up calls on its own. Dies very fast! Annoying., The stop working in 2 weeks, Extremely scratched and banged up. Shouldn't have passed quality control. Unless the standards are that low, Perfect condition, The battery on my other phone was only lasting me from 7 am - 1 pm so I figured I would get a new phone - The new phone is lasting from 7 am - 11am and says the battery is 100% healthy...., Worst purchase ever don't waste time on this item does not even turn on turns mad hot 1st day on arrival does not turn on 2nd day return hopefully all turn out good with money back update later on, Phone has no signal, Antenna broke internally on phone within 4 months just outside the 3 month return window.  Worked great until then., i liked it except for the fact that the back had some dints in it and u can’t turn it on silent mood, Look good, Speaker are not working, Arrived a day early which is usually nice, but I planned my schedule around it arriving on the estimated delivery date. It had obvious wear on the back and there was a small blotch on the screen that must've been dead pixels or something because it was pure white regardless of what was on the screen. I didn't like it in this condition, so I returned it and they said they would deduct return shipping cost from my refund but they ended up not doing that., The phone I received did not have a working microphone. Couldn’t record or make calls. The company issued me a full refund. They have great customer service but sold a faulty device so I gave a neutral rating., Honestly I was so nervous to buy a phone from Amazon for the 7 year old stepson ... but reviews can be very deceiving .. phone worked GREAT !! Now if I can only get this 7 year old to come back to earth and stay off the phone lol needles to say he loves it ..., The phone doesn’t work. I can hear a person I call, but they can’t hear me., I loved this phone for about a half a year and loved it! However, I got a message saying my SIM card could not be read. Turns out that this is a known iPhone mistake when iPhones are built. When I brought it to the Apple store they said that because it was originally made in Japan they could not fix it or send me a new one. I am now out for a new phone. However it worked very well when it did, I just wouldn’t risk it., My battery dies way too soon. The package also arrived much later than expected and also had a decent scratch in the screen deep enough to affect the overall appearance. The camera works just as expected but it definitely was not the “new” look you can definitely see the precious wear and tear on the iphone., No work for Verizon, Great phone thank you, i was confused by the packet  i received with item, it said iphone 5s - i was ready to return(im a new iphone user) i was kinda disappointed with charger not working - had to buy additional one to use phone - overall its a great item -, The phone was very nice looking phone, but I had to return the  phone due to it was not compatible with my sprint network service., The phone constantly restarts itself. The battery lasts all of 10 minutes. I do not recommend buying a phone from this company.. they’re junk., I've only had this Iphone 7 a few days. The reason I bought it is because my previous Iphone wouldn't hold a charge for more than a few hours. So far this Iphone will hold a charge for 2 days with moderate use. I'm happy with it so far. The charger that came with it did not work but I still have my previous Iphone charger that did work. Other than that I am happy with it. It didn't have any scratches or anything and looks brand new., This review is for the seller Hybrid IT. First of all, I wasn’t expecting it to come as fast as it did. I ordered my phone Friday at 3 AM and received it Saturday by 12 PM, that’s kind of insane since they are in NY and i’m in FL. There are a few small scuffs on the bottom of the device near the speaker but otherwise it’s pretty close to perfect cosmetically. The screen has no scratches at all, i can’t tell if it’s the original but if it was replaced they did a hell of a job. The max battery capacity is 100%. it came with a charger but no headphones or headphone adapter so you will need to buy one. i haven’t experienced any issues so far but it’s only been a day so i will make sure to come back and give an update.Also if you have Metro by TMobile and you’re having trouble getting service after inserting your SIM, you have to register the phone with them before it will work, not sure about other carriers. for a second i thought i received a locked/stolen phone but i wanted to make sure. don’t give up unless the carrier actually tells you it won’t work. you can try calling the customer service number and doing it with the automated system or a representative but if you don’t have access to your old phone you need to go into the store. It took 5 minutes and only costs $15-20 depending on where you live.Overall i’m extremely pleased, it was a risk but i’m happy i seem to have gotten a good device. Thankful for all the reviews recommending to buy from this seller., The maximum capacity of the battery was on 74% when I received the phone. I can only use the phone for a few hours before the battery is completely dead. Other than them sending it with a bad battery the phone works great., DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!! I got this in today after looking for a good phone for my son for about 2 months the home button didn't work and you can't use Verizon it is not Amazon renewed its a scam, Phone is ok, no marks or scratches, but came with outdated ios that needed to be updated prior to transferring data from old phone.  Battery life isn't great., There are times when a phone is set to support another carrier, and even after a full factory reset, any carrier update will kill your mobile network.  Happened to me.  Sprint/T-mobile reset it and tried multiple times, and every time we got it to work, it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a day.That means no calls, no text, no internet if you're outside of wifi.Be warned and keep your old phone handy.  You may be disappointed like i was., Every renewed phone I’ve gotten before this one had a renewed battery. This one did not. Will have to get one soon, phone charge only last a few hours. Would not have bought it if I would have known the battery was not renewed., ok, It was good phone till a month after purchase kinda salty about it still wish i didnt spend on the phone also did not come with the right charger, I like the condition of the phone. It really looks as good as new.The problem is on the earphones plug. Should provide the adapter., The phone was ok. I had a few issues but nothing major., Gof a great product. Fast response, Phone worked great for about 6 months. Then it stopped connecting to the cellular service. Trying to update it and the phone says that I can’t. Called Apple support and they can’t do anything since phone is no longer under warranty., Everything was good except the battery came to me at 80% capacity.  So when it charges to 💯 it’s never better than 80%.  The seller offered me a 20.00 credit but I can’t find an authorized dealer to change the battery.  🤷‍♀️, This phone is almost perfect!!! The only thing about this device is that I can’t get it turned on due to the fact that it won’t accept a SIM card. I found this misleading due to the fact that they told me my device was renewed and compatible with certain carriers., Nice piece, My son loves it. Arrived quick, looks new, &amp; works great! He’s been smiling since, Received the phone in the usual blank white box refurbs come in, shipping was fast and it came with an android charger block and a no name lightning cable.Phone came with one long deep scratch, a cracked home button, and a couple other much smaller nicks and scratches, enough that it was off putting for me. Battery life showed 92% which is excellent however the phone did seem to lag after only my second week with it.Phone was unlocked as stated and I had no issues switching in my sim and using the phone right away. Overall a decent phone but I will be returning it because of the the cracked Touch ID button and deep scratches, The phone does not work properly it heats up so hot every time we try and use it ., Gift good condtion, A good way to get a new iPhone at a good price, The battery is useless, it takes 3 hours of use to fully recharge, needs to be replaced, All seemed as expected from the seller and from description except battery life was not 80% or above as stated in listing but 70%.The biggest issue with this was having to pay, send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promised.This just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending, then what else are they not checking with these phones., Didn’t come with any kind of paperwork and it’s working but the touchscreen can freeze up at times., Although i was very happy to get a much needed upgrade from my old 5s and this was just the right size there were a couple of things i was not satisfied with and almost sent the phone back. First of all Amazon stated the battery would be able to be charged at a minimum of 80% its original capacity mine was not it was around 75% i figured ok well i suppose i could live with that but amazon also states that there will be no visible blemishes on the phone viewed from 12 inches that was not the case with mine the finish on one of the rear corners about a half inch the entire corner of the phone was completely wore off once again i decided I could live with that since it is the rear and would be covered with the case. Overall im happy with the speed and functionality of the phone though and the screen camera and everything work great. I’m not happy that i will end up putting another 50 to 100 dollars into a phone that cost me about 200 in order to get a new full capacity battery that lasts longer for media and extended use, Daughter loves it, No fingerprints reader and the phone Glitches a lot, I was switching phones because the one I was using had a battery that was starting to die. However this one does just as quickly and got so hot it almost hurt to hold it., I just opened this product and charged it fully for two hours and unplugged it. As I’m sitting here on my old phone to port over my SIM card credentials, the battery went from 100 to 88% within 8 minutes. I just saw the numbers dropping right before my eyes. The phone transfer and condition are really good but the battery is terrible. I wish the guarantee included a new battery. (Health is reading at 83% out of the box)., The phone is very small., BATTERY LIFE NOT AS ADVERTISED  ONLY 56%NO ANSWER FROM SELLER, The phone looked good function well but was defective it had something loose inside and I had return it, I’d definitely buy again. This the real deal fr. Y’all should try them out! I got my money’s worth ., The battery life last about 2 to 3 hours., Great phone, defiantly recommend. It’s a little weird at times like it takes a while to turn on after it dies sometimes and I can’t have certain pictures as my screensaver for some reason. It would black out parts of it but I only had that problem with two of my pictures. Other than that for a refurbished phone it’s pretty good., I've boughten iPhones from amazon before, two different iPhone 6s. This time, I could only find iPhone 7, so if figured \"why not?\". I'll tell you why, this seller sent a defective phone. It worked perfectly the first day, and then 24 hours later it told me I needed to update it or else my cellular data wouldn't work (which means I could not receive or send any texts or calls!). Sure enough, I updated it, and it worked, for another few hours, until it said it needed ANOTHER UPDATE! Unfortunately, it was already up to date as it could be. So I took it in to the \"geniuses\" at APPLE, and they said THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH iPhone 7, YOU NEED TO REPLACE IT. And that was it. Returning, hopefully that goes smoothly. Avoid iPhone 7, too sketchy., excellent product</td>\n",

       "      <td>It’s thick, but works good once you get used to it!, These base and top coats work great for an at home gel mani-pedi. My only issue was when i tried to soak and scrape it off, it seemed like the base layer bonded almost TOO well with my nail, and part of my nail layers scraped off. I had to take a few months break between the next gel manicure because my nails were damaged. This could just be user error or the fact that my nails are extremely thin. They held up great though, and looked beautiful., the product works great, the only reason i didn’t give five stars was because it smells TERRIBLE. like a skunk almost and it’s very strong. but it works, and works well., I would buy it again. Beats having to use nail polish remover in the end. Best quality I’ve ever used at home. Nails come out looking professional. Very easy to use. I recommend it., smells awful, While the polish is great, every bottle I've ever had from them, 4, ALL HAVE LEAKED when on their side., I love this product it’s very easy and it last for 14 days, Best brand for top coat and base!! My favorite one, Terrible product. The base coat seemed to work fine, but the top coat was in such a gel-like consistency that I couldn't even use it. No matter how hard I shook the bottle up, it remained the same. Waste of money. Only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the base coat worked. All in all, NOT HAPPY!!!, The base coat is horrible. You’re better off just buying the top coat only. Top coat is average I would say. I’ve done my manicures without the base and they come out better. The base causes the polish to look bumpy., Really cool that I can do this at home. Just light and done!, My top coat bottle came completely empty. I am returning for a replacement but it’s disappointing!, Poor quality, was only good the first few uses. Base coat became thick and does not go on smoothly at all. Product quality changes over very short time. Would not recommend. Both me and my sister are allergic to this product. After some use it causes nail bed pain and inflammation., It's great that you take a picture... but it helps if you show the door # !!! This was dropped off at 104!? NOT 106, I could not get the base coat to dry fully.  I used my UV light 5 times (5 min) and it was still tacky.  I gave up and went ahead and put polish over it anyway.  The polish I used thankfully was able to dry just fine.  The top coat seemed to dry much better but I won't be using this brand again., Overall this is a good set. It can be thick so be sure to wipe the brush on the side of the bottle before applying and when covering your nail. Make sure to use thinner coats and apply evenly or else you’ll see the lines/uneven levels after curing.For curing times, I have a UV LED lamp and wasn’t sure how long to cure for. Top coat 60 seconds is perfect. Cures hard and comes off easily when time to remove. For base coat I tried 60 seconds but was having a hard time when removing it, so I went down to 30 seconds and that seems to have helped., Top coat dried out in the bottle after 3 uses. Returned!, Perfect, Bottles came leaking from the top. The gel polish I got to go along with these two bottles was perfectly fine and intact. Why these leaked I don’t know. I haven’t used them yet either since most of the product was all over the box it came in., Top coat goes on nicely and leaves a nice shinny coat and is not sticky., Pretty easy to come because the polish came off within a week. I would have expected it to last at least 2 weeks., Very small but not too bad, Nice, not that good, This product worked amazingly well. After a minute under LED /UV it was dry. Very sheer and worked well with my polygel kit., First time trying this brand and my last. Very, very thin like a refusal polish, not hard at all. Nails broke easily. I do not recommend this brand., Great product, Amazing! Lasts the longest out of anything I’ve tried!, This is a peel off formula. I do follow all the instructions for application and I never use acetone to remove. I soak in water for a few minutes or just hand wash some dishes and I am able to peel of the polish most times I one piece. Now while that its awesome because it removes easily, the manicure does not last past 2 days with out major chipping., I used it the first time and it worked real good! but the second time was horrible, I could not get it to set correctly, it was in a way clumpy? it sucks because I really wanted to like it., Horrible product. Does not stay on. The top coat has a thick glue like consistency and does not spread on nail well. Peels off within a couple of days. So disappointed., Is just a oil, It is clumpy and didn’t even dry all the way through, now my nails are smudged.Está muy gruesa y no se secaron bien mis uñas., I ordered the base &amp; top coat about 4 years ago &amp; I loved it. I started doing my own nails again so I wanted to try it again...bad idea. The base coat works fine but the top coat started clumping &amp; was too thick &amp; this was only the first use. Maybe they’ve changed the polish since the last time I used it but I won’t be ordering it again., Works fine doesn’t last too long though., The base coat good, but the top coat is trash! Starts peeling the next day., Great base and tip coat!! Lasts atleast 3 weeks for me!!, Not even an Ounce, I have tried various steps in an effort to get this polish to last longer than 7 days. It doesn't matter what I do it chips and looks like crap and has to be changed by day 7. I bought this base and top with Amelie gel polish., The topcoat got extremely clumpy after the second use causing an unsmooth finish., I was super excited to get my gel polishes in with such fantastic ratings- unfortunately the product was so thick when i went to apply, it applied like a literal paste.  There is no good use for this polish and I would like a refund promptly., I love the no wipe too coat. Saves me some time., This brand doesn’t hold up, the shellac peels off a lot sooner then expected., seriously soooo good! i do my own gel nails/toes at home and this is by far the best set i’ve gotten. gel polish is definitely an art and takes a long time to master - if this set “lifts” you probably just aren’t doing your gel application correctly. these two are excellent! also added bonus you don’t need to wipe the top coat :), The item itself is good but the bottles are very very tiny. I wish they made them a little bigger for the price., This does what it says it will do and the top coat is not sticky at all when it sets. The only complaint I have is that if you try to close the bottle when there is polish on the brush and the polish gets onto the mouth of the bottle, the cap will actually shrink wrap onto the mouth of the bottle making it very hard to open! This has happened to me several times so now I make sure there is no polish on the outside of the mouth of the bottle and I try to close it very gently not tightly. Please be aware of how you close this nail polish otherwise it will take FOREVER TO OPEN when you want to use it again., I really loved this product for the first few months! But recently began to have an allergic reaction to the product! I'm bummed I have to switch it up now because its great quality. Not saying don't buy it-- but definitely be mindful!, Very good product. Will buy again., applies and cures well, but dulls your manicure significantly. Also the base coat is difficult to remove., Bought for my sister who does nails and she didn’t like it... sadly, I like the product it’s a good shine and it lasts about two weeks I was pleased., The gel has a murky purple coating during the day time. It glows green under UV light.  When comparing this top coat to my Kupa inc Top coat there is a huge difference in color. Kupa inc top coat is clear and the Aimeli has the Murky Purple coating., So in love with this gel. It is thick and gets into all the nooks and crannies. It was actually recommended by a nail tech on you tube (nailed by nikki) and I had to try.  So far I am loving this product!!! If you don't like thick gel this is not for you but trudt you won't regret this buy., Top coat does not wear well. Base coat works great!, Dislike, Great base and top coat for gel nails, Not bad I've ordered it several times wish they would sell a matte top gel with these too, I was scared at first because it Was still tacky after curing under UV light but I read it’s supposed to be so polish will stick. Continued with my nail routine and it turned out well! Really great product especially for the price!!, Great for beginners. Works well, I brought the polish the size of the bottle for what you pay is pretty small I don’t blink your eyes, This chips and peels off, about like regular nail polish.  It is nothing like \"gel nails\" that you get in the salon, which is what I was looking for., Top coat turns yellow after a few days. I have used the base and top coat 4 times so far, and every time my nails start turning yellow after a few days. I have tried different curing times and even wiped the top coat after, but nothing seems to fix it. This has never happened with other brands of gel top coat I have used., Worked pretty good, good product for the price ! I usually get opi but this did the job, This was great for the price. Only issue was it did chip in some nails but that may have been true to operator error, I may not have cured the polish long enough. All in all I’m happy with my purchase. Also, arrived a lot sooner than I had anticipated., This! I can’t even begin! This is an amazing base and top coat my nails lasted! It was easy to use, and great for gels!I love it, This is my first gel base and top coat so I really don't have anything to compare it to., This must be a cheaper brand or the base coat is just bad. I have been using file off gel polish and I was noticing that I have a problem not damaging my nail when filing it off. It wasn't killing my nails, but I figured soak off would case me to do less accidental damage.I bought this brand because it was prime available and somewhat inexpensive. In a week I have had two nails (one on each hand) peel completely off. Its not like the free edge got loose. It just was really lifted in the middle or edge where it frowns in, and the loose polish would get peeled up to an awkward place where I had to remove it or it would peel even more off the top layer of my nails. One happened in just 3 days. THREE DAYS. I fixed those two jankity nails and I also added a second coat of just the top coat to all of my nails after 1 week. I can't tell if the top coat is better or not.Now this does have a perk. Its super easy to soak off and remove. Like wow it removes like butter. But, if its coming off super easy because it falls off of a well prepped nail in less than a week, this is a problem. I can now see why this has some lower ratings and why people would spend at least double on a widely known US name brand. Will I use the rest of teh bottle? Yes. I am cheap! I also like changing my nail polish color frequently if I can pull that off. This soaks off so easy that I could totally change my polish all the time. But, it also just falls off which means when I am too busy to do a manicure once a week this just flat out sucks.Edit: I have updated this review because after sitting and soaking off the polish I am really happy with how my nails look. They aren't damaged or sad looking. It really did just bubble up and off. This wouldn't be my choice for wearing before going on vacation or trying to wear for weeks in a row since it doesn't bubble up and come off easily, but if you like to change your nail color a couple of times a week you will be happy with this polish.8/8 Update: I keep trying this base/top coat FOOLISHLY because I have it. It keeps performing poorly. Polish just pops off within a day or two of application.  Just spend more and get Gelish. Even with shrinkage at least it stays on the nail better. Its my own fault for trying it again, but good grief., Peels easy, This basecoat is whack. Upon applying it, it’s separated like crazy. When I applied my gel color over top it also would separate on top until the second or third layer when it evened out. The topcoat is great, not tacky once it’s been cured and works as advertised., Top coat and base coat is very thick hard to apply thin.  Took forever to cure and was sticky had to put under the led light a lot longer than suggested to cure and then my thumb completely peeled off, This is the worst gel I've ever used. Doesnt really fully harden.  Peels off. Not durable at all. Do not reccommend!!, Not good dont buy this, This item is a great price for the two bottles. And it a product that I like because of the no wipe top coat, and it give a nice shiny finish., Easy to use and has a nice longevity! Impressed with the quality., Not so well, I used this base and top coat with the Gellen polish brand. This stuff works great- top coat is very glossy and dries fast with the UV lamp. Like instantly dry. I’ve had these nails for 2 weeks and the gloss wore off a smidge but that’s expected after 2 weeks. Still hasn’t chipped or lost ALL glossiness. I recommended this brand to 2 friends. Overall great purchase! I will be buying the colors next., I am reasonably new to gel nails and this was my first set of top and base, which I bought as Amazon reccommended it. I am fully aware of how long it takes to remove gel, but this stuff DOES NOT COME OFF. An hour of working at it every manicure with sandpaper, bowls of acetone, and wraps, and it just does not budge. Yet, it manages to lift along my cuticle line after a week and a half. Buy something higher quality and experiment with inexpensive gel colors. Lesson learned., I do like this but do not get to close to the sides of your nail. It will peel up. I can get it to last 7 to 10 days so I guess it's not to bad. Its not easy to take off unless it is peeling up. I am by no means a pro with my nails so it could totally be something that I am doing wrong but for the price it's not a bad product., Great quality for the price. Convenient that you don’t have to use rubbing alcohol after use. My nails stay on really well using the base and top coat. Used with uv light., look nice but the nail polish only last like 4 days., Liked this product and the cost is fair. I have used name brands that have cost more and this brand is equivalent., Bottles were broken at the cap. Bottles spilled out the contents. Was not able to be used. Very disappointed, This is my favorite base &amp; top coat set. I definitely wish that they made bigger bottles or maybe a refill bottle because I literally have to order a new set every week. I go through them too quickly and having the option to just refill my bottle would be so amazing., I really like this base/ top coat but it does leave almost a blue tint to the polish sometimes or it can be streaky., I am new to the DIY UV lamp. This is a must have for UV gel! Make sure your nails are clean and dry before you put the base coat (wiping with alcohol works well). Would recommend and buy again, Not a big fan of this. The base coat never dries (which I know is kind of okay cause it's a base coat) but overall it just takes forever under the lamp. And by that time things like dust get stuck in the polish so it's weird., Was old, Really smooth and shiny but it has a really strong smell, Bought for a friend and she said it's the best she's used this far. I'll stick to the Beetles brand but it's good to know there's an alternative that works well if necessary., good, This top coat sucks. It gets so cloudy and it doesn’t shine, I bought this as my first gel base and top coat. Polish lasted the average two week which was great. However, no matter how careful I applied it, it always left imperfections. Like it shrinks when it sets up under the light. Perfect and smooth going on. Ripples when dried. I tried it with many different colors/brands and always got the same result. I will stick to my new favorite CNC Shellac. Perfect every time, Used it twice. By the second time, the product had already become a useless gooey substance.Waste of money., I work whole day and full time mom and this works great lasts 10 days!, Easy to apply, Received today and not sure if this is oldProduct but I can’t get the top coat bottle open not sure but it’s definitely defective, You NEED the no wipe top for any of their polishes., I use plenty top coat but this is the worst by far, Works great., Pretty nice polish., After using this product as instructed I realized that the topcoat comes off way too easy. I am not happy with it. I do like the builder gel but other than that I do not like this product, My base coat takes a longer time to dry other than that will by again, Love the colors but peels off ez on natural nails, This set is really nice and works well for acrylic nails. Be warned that on natural nails the top coat burns when cured. Otherwise this product is awesome., Trash !!, I love the base and top coat the only problem I’ve had is that the top coat came really lumpy but I’ve been working through it and just wiping the clumps off as I work. But over all they’re both great and last., i love how it goes on----i got so excited i ordered more----but it chips after a few days---am so very disappointed in that---would not buy again----now that i already have!!!, bought it as a result of all them better tthan positive reviews, i was not at all disappointed! definitely recommended with no reservations!, Long lasting, but a few cons. The product is very runny so you have to be careful, otherwise you'll have a lot of clean up around your cuticles to do before curing. I didn't have issues with peeling or chipping until a couple weeks later, so that's a plus. The biggest con for me was the removal. I'm not sure this is really \"soak off\". I soak cotton balls in 100% pure acetone and wrap in foil. After 40 minutes, only the top coat budged.... A little. My gel polish, another brand, peeled off very easily, but underneath the base coat was hard as a rock. This is the same thing that happens when I use my regular gel polish top coat and forget that it has to filed off and accidentally soak them., I love a good base and top coat but I do not want it to be so thick. This product is much thicker than any I have used so far and I had a lot of bubbling on my nail and for these reasons I am passing on future purchases., I've been using these for years. Seems like the formula changed lately. Less shiny, doesn't have the same look under the LED light. Not sure how it will hold up., Top coat was clumpy. Purchased 2 x happened to both top coats, The top coat was not going on well.  I had to replace the top coat with a different brand but I still use the base coat, The base coat works quite well (difficult to remove it though), but after 1 or 2 uses the top coat doesn’t work very well at all. It bubbles like crazy leaving a polka dot texture,  and my nails start chipping after 4 or 5 days of wear. Would not recommend., Functionally decent. They smell atrocious though, more so than any nail product I've smelled in my life. Acrylic smells better than this stuff, it's like burning plastic straight from the bottle. Needs over 60 seconds under UV to set but that's not a huge deal., I don’t know what I’ve been doing wrong, if anything, but the base coat cures in a weird way. It will almost bubble and shrink to one side of my nail. I thought it was my technique or lamp, but I later found out it wasn’t the case. The top coat is pretty solid though, so I’ll keep using that., I was so excited about finding a cheaper alternative to the Sally Hansen brand - but the first time I stuck my hands in any water, the top coat chipped right off and looked awful. Also took a long time to cure., It's cheap, but you should probably just pay a bit more for a better top coat., Nice gel. As expected., Applies well, dries well with my lamp, is no wipe. My only complaint is that it doesn't get thick or strong enough., This product works for maybe a day or 2 but after that it peels off or chips easily. So with that being said it definitely easy to remove lol. Would recommend just spending the money on a better product that might cost more. You will save yourself time!, I've had these for some time now. I do prefer this formula over other brands, HOWEVER, after using for a while, the outside of the bottles gets extremely sticky. There is still plenty of polish left over in the bottle, so I hate to throw it away, but I might have to replace them because I can't stand the feeling. Other than that, everything is great. Just make sure that you keep them upright all the time and be careful when using., This is amazing product., Love this product works great cures in 30secs. Would recommend 2 anyone who wants stronger lasting 💅 nails, Polish started chipping on day 1. To be fair, it may have been the UV lamp I was using because I think it was defective; hence the extra 2 stars., I love that you don't have to wipe the topcoat, but no matter how long I soak my nails… The basecoat will not come off! I have excellent soak off fingernail  polish remover, But the basecoat will not come off  all of the way . I'm going to have to sand it off my nails., Wow! This stuff lasts a very long time, however it took me 3 separate times of soaking my nails with acetone to remove the top coat at 20 minutes each time. I buffed my nails first to scratch it too. It might be easier to let the polish grow out! The top coat polish keeps its shine for entire time. This stuff lasts a long time.The base coat didn't even come off, so I just buffed it off with my nail file.I want to give this a great review, the price is so good, it's just so darn hard to remove. I like the other polish colors, but just will use my other brand base and top coats instead., Polish was awful, it was thick and difficult to apply because it didn’t flow from the brush...it globbed. I did use the curing light-thinking it might kind of smooth out a bit??  and it took 4-5 mins  (supposed to take ONE minute!!)  to make it “seem” ok but it never did completely dry. HUGE waste of my money and my time, The top coat is amazing! I love it. The base coat is weird (minus a star).  You have to put a super EVEN coat on the whole nail and it can’t be too thin of a layer because it becomes uneven. You have to use just the right amount. Anyway, it makes me wonder if the base coat is even necessary. Also, the base coat doesn’t dry hard after the lamp. It’s a bit sticky so don’t touch it. That’s supposedly normal though., I have mixed feelings about this product. The first time I  used the polish it was amazing!! But the next time I used it it was like the top coat was setting/hardening on the brush. I pulled that clump off and then went on it worked just as the first time. But then when I go to use it the 3rd time there is little hard pieces all over the brush. The was no sticky film once you cure it under the light. I just wish I for more uses out of it rather than looking like 3... I've used many gel polishes but this is the first to do this. I may have gotten a bad batch or something. I really like the base coat I have had no problem with the my polish coming off of my nail., Sticky, very sticky, I don’t feel like it is quite as shiney  as previous ones I have purchased, Pretty good.  Once dry there are no problems with chipping or peeling.  But need to take extra time under the UV lamp.  I've used two different brand lamps and both take a while to dry.  So, be patient and you have a great polish., I've used several different base and top coats but when I used this one it started peeling off after 3 days. Nice shine but that's a bummer., Doesnt stay on., Really shiny, easy to use, but for some reasons, it turns yellow after a couple days (3-4)., I've been sandwhiching my my old polish with great success. Lasts over a week, I haven't waited for it to chip to remove.I don't notice any funky smell like other reviewers.I have to say though, the base coat is difficult to remove. I have to do a second round of buffing and soaking to get it off, and still have to buff of the remnants.PS. You have to let your nail polish dry before you put on the top coat or it will never dry!, Will buy again, Leaked everywhere. Such a mess. Had to throwaway., VERY disappointed in this product. I have used a better top and base coat in the past and repurchased those instead. I missed the cut off to return it, but I honestly would. It didn’t last more than a week!, This base coat was unbelievably bad.  It applied smoothly (to freshly washed &amp; cleaned nails that had been wiped clean of residue with alcohol), then as it cured it drew together into raised rivulets, leaving other parts of the nails completely bare. It also went spiky, with little points all over it that gave it a texture like there was sand mixed in. Needless to say, this did not provide a smooth canvas for my manicure, and when two coats of gel polish over it still couldn’t completely smooth it out, my only choice was to put a glitter overcoat over everything to camouflage it. So unimpressed!, Love ,love ,love. Very easy to apply and the topcoat is amazing. Week 3 and no chips on my nails. I have tried many other products,  but this is the BEST.  Highly recommend., TerribleQuality, make sure you are sober when you put it on the first. it's more difficult than regular polish, but it is 100% worth it,  very great colors and it last a lot longer., Base is not good. Top coat does cure pretty quickly but they really don't help the gel stay on longer as my gel chipped the next day. Was pretty annoyed at that., Good quality, very shiny but to little of product, I am glad I bought these but the top coat has been leaking a bit out of the top so it won’t last as long as I’d like but I still am pretty glad I bought it! And the price isn’t bad either!, I love this brand these are amazing, Unlike some name brand's, this product is too soft and allows your nails to tear. And peels off way too easy., It's ok I trying better that keep your nail polish on. More two day sad I have to do my nails very two days cause of product isn't good. Not worth the money., Excellent base &amp; top coat. Makes my nails really shiny and hard and my polish last for 2+ weeks. But it does seem to dent if you push your nail or something sharp into it and for that I’m removing one start. Removal is easy too with a 180 grit file., I gave it 2 star's because the base coat get hard at all so I order a different kind I hope it works better, Bad quality, I use gel polish that does not require a base coat, so I only use the top coat. It dries down nice and hard and does not have a sticky finish. My biggest complaint is that the top coat almost separates, and does not provide an even finish. Does the job, for the most part.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was not impressed with the image quality.  Also the app that was suggested to use my phone as a remote for it did not work properly., Biggest pain to attach to a helmet. But works well otherwise., the only thing about the camera was that i had no clue it was so small., We enjoy using this camera to get a canine view of our dogs' activities! It fits well into their harness and we get to see them running, swimming, and playing. There are a large number of function and features, so reading the instructions is a must, especially to take full advantage of the power of this camera. It holds up well to use, we've had no problems with it in several months. Would definitely purchase again!, Not a good purchase, This camera works as advertised and video quality is more than I expected. Great features for the price. The adhesive in some of the mounts could be better. I wish they had special mount for ski helmets., This is a 12 megapixel camera with 4K video. Waterproof case is good and numerous attachments for mounts are included. Photo quality is less than average compared to my iPhone 6s and I can not get videos to play at all. Overall I would spend a few extra dollars and buy a better platform to capture life with., I bought this as a gift for my son, we haven't had a chance to use it just yet. The only issue I've had was inserting the SD memory card. Something seemed to be wrong with the slot. It wouldn't stay inserted all the way in, it seemed it was engaged like it already had a card in the slot. After some time I did manage to get it in correctly. We did do a practice video and took a picture, it has nice quality. We cant wait until the weather warms more to try it out., Bought this for my 9 year old son several months ago. It has been great. Glad we bought it. High quality for the reasonable price and a tough little camera.  It’s holding up well! No negatives I can think of. Works well with phone app. Glad I didn’t spend the extra money for GP. No need. This thing does it all. Lots of videos on YouTube comparing the two. See for yourself., Does not always stay on.I use it as a dash camera., The WIFI system sucks on this camera and the app it requires you to use keep crashing. I found another use for the camera but I would never by this camera again., I love this camera, works wonders for dirt bike trail riding and capturing sea life under water!, Product shipped fast, seems like a great camera so far just recently started using so not sure how to rate long term  yet., Audio doesn't pick up well in the protective case but the video is great. We're still learning to use it but the grandkids have fun recording things., I got this for my husband for a gift, the app didn't seem to work well with his Motorola phone, sinking issues and gave up on it. He has recently uodated to a new Samsung Galaxy 10, so hopefully will be able to get it to work w/it., Good price but takes terrible videos. It’s not worth the time to even save these videos. Look at the videos on the feedback, I don’t know why people think this is a good camera. Don’t waste your time., Very difficult to figure out what parts go to what and what they are used for. If you give them a good review they’ll give you another accessory that you’ll have no idea how to use. NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL INCLUDED. I guess you get what you pay for. I should have checked YouTube before purchasing this. Got it today, returning tomorrow., So far I'm impressed with this product. One things for sure no matter what u plan on mounting it to there's an accessory included to do so. I've only had it for a day but so far so good., doesn’t upload to your computer. Hard to work, This little cam is really good i went to the Bahamas last week and took many under water videos and photos and this camera work like a dream just remember to put in a high speed micro SD card (not included)., I absolutely love this and i have recommended it to all of my friends. I would definitely purchase this again. Thank you, No way that this is 12MP. No. Way! Also (and this was the main reason why I returned it)), the batteries lasted less than half an hour on a full charge. And, for some reason, the only way I could have turned on the camera was if I removed the battery from its compartment and re-insert it., Product works very well.  I use it for fishing and nature hikes. Taking videos hands free is a big advantage. I was impressed with all of the attachment accessories.Excellent value., While the picture is great, it appears that you have to set the date and time every time you change the battery. I haven't found anything in the manual that will save the date and time permanently which is unacceptable. Well I just found it #11. It says \"if you replace the battery, date and time will reset\". WT???????, Disappointing didn’t even work for 30mins in the water and stop working. Don’t waste your money!!!, UPDATED review:(SUPPORT to the Win) After seeing this review, the manufacturer emailed me back, and sent me 2 new batteries no charge, and both were timed by filming a clock, (lol) and both did about 2hrs of run time, of course i ran this once on each. Once summer comes i will pull out the helmet cam and go riding and push the camera to the limit. Advice, be sure to keep the camera outside of the waterpoof case if your riding in the heat, it gets hot with those batteries. Thanks Akaso for the follow upOriginal Review:I purchased this for my mtn bike rides and well it works nice but if you like having to try and time yourself on the trail and at 20 min per battery and only have 2 batteries than well, go for it, its a nice toy. Otherwise ya pay for what you get., The quality of the camera is about what you would expect for $60. It works exceptionally well in brightly lit areas like the outdoors and it also has a wide variety of attachments that make it great for whatever activity you plan on documenting such as hiking, water sports or skating.It's a great entry camera for people who are interested in getting involved with filmography., So I bought this item last year for a Xmas gift, and we are now just being able to use it. And the cord doesn't charge the battery, Works great for its price as well as wrist watch works with Simonides cameras as well great product great battery life, Lots of ways to use this camera. Ordered this thinking it would b great to b able to video our hunting dogs.  We were surprise at all the features it offered.  Must download the instructions and read carefully in order to get the best use from camera., Gave to grandchild.  Loves to show what he does., Wouldn't work for half my trip bought a memory card for it that was ment for the device, kept saying card in valid,battery's lasted about an 1hr, Have not had a chance to give a performance test of it. The box ship in was way to small for the item and it could have (lucky it did not) get damaged. So right now only can say packaging was not good. Will see later this week if camera is any good., It seems like a good camera. I have only used it in the pool so far.  I won't do scuba diving with it until June.The instructins are VERY lacking so it makes it much harder to figure out how to use.Also, I thought it had WAY to many extra parts that I will NEVER use., Very very, complicated. It will take a while to figure out., After opening the box and trying to figure it all out with no so hot directions and diagrams, I gave up and gave it to a friend's son who has more experience with the tech.  So many pieces and it was just not worth it for me.  I never even got it working so I can't judge the camera at all.  So, if you are into high tech camera stuff, it might be great, average user, not so much., It's not a bad unit if you're not willing to spend the money on the higher quality cameras. Bought it for hunting but it's hard to use in a pinch., No comparison to the GoPro.Not many features. No zooming capabilities. I guess you get what you pay for.Update: since posting the above I was contacted by Akaso and offered a partial refund which I received immediately once I agreed to it. Very good customer service., Camera shoots video really well for the price, however the app that goes with it is garbage, This is a good value camera we use for family events. Great price for an action cam, It's a solid camera pictures are ok. But, they look better on my phone. The batteries die pretty quick, I bought this as a second action cam to use for a different angle. The reviews I saw made it look impressive. My main camera is a Gopro Hero 4 so the video and audio quality just doesn't compare. If you were using 2 or 3 of these you could get by ok but this one just can't begin to keep up. It's kinda like a Volkswagen and a Ferrari having a race.One handy item with it that I didn't think I would use in the remote control. For videos, I just don't see much use but for snapping a picture it does \"ok\"., Not what I expected., Did not like that it was not compatible with my laptop or my android phone.  I needed a Mac computer or video editor to down load my videos., Fell off my motorcycle and broke and pieces first time out never got to use it, This product never worked. I took two videos and then it stopped turning on. Being the only camera I took on my trip to Egypt, I was very dissapointed., Takes amazing still shots at 60 fps while traveling at 55+ mph. Do not buy this if you are mounting it to anything that goes down the road. Instead spend a few dollars more and get the Brave 4 which is the upgrade to this model, which includes image stabilization. I can't report yet on how good that feature is on the other camera having bought it to replace this one. However, this one creates unwatchable video, at least mounted to a motorcycle. The image shudder is horrendous. You see some four different layers of the horizon jumbled together when playing back the video on the computer.  On this lower model the remote required the camera to be active for the two buttons to work. They do not turn the camera on. They don't stay lit as an indicator. On the back the lcd is nice, but to determine which mode is active, you have to look closely for the white camera icon to go red, when recording. When taking a snapshot, the screen flickers and resets to the camera, non recording mode. I used this flickering  indicator to know if the camera was recording, while looking through a tinted windshield where its mounted on the front of my bike.The upper model seems to have addressed some of these concerns, for the better. I'll have to review it once i get out on the bike and test it. There is yet another model that is even higher priced than the Brave 4, that one s You tuber claimed had real 4k and not digitally processed 4k like these two lower models, if that's a concern. I had no complaint with the still frame on this camera at speed, set to 60fps, even if it is not true 4k., This arrived with the plastic part that holds the camera to the handle broken.  It worked for the first couple of days, then the charging became iffy to the point where I had to hold the cable titled for it to charge. Then the next day the USB port fell inward into the unit and it could no longer charge.  The failure of the USB port after only a couple uses indicates that the manufacturing of this product is inferior. The camera was returned., Used it 4 times and now it doesn't work. I hope the added warranty is better than the camera., I bought this camera to help record a ski trip with my kids.  The biggest negative I have for it is that the camera is not waterproof.  I couldn't get any audio with the camera because it was stuck inside a waterproof case the whole time.  The worst part is the case got scratched on the lense so now I cant use the case and cant seem to find a replacement., DONT DO IT!!! My husband and I got this for our cruise and the SD card wouldn’t go in the camera. It’s like a piece was blocking it from going in so we couldn’t use it at all. Tried to get in contact and nothing. Spend the extra money for name brand of this is what off brand is like., I appreciate the quality of this product, Just received this yesterday. I have downloaded to apps in order to get videos. One says it download once you go to it you can only hear it. The other one let's you download it but can't share it anywhere because it's only the sound as well. You need a better app for people who only have phones to use. I'm going to try a couple more things but so far not really that great because of the app. If someone could let me know what they use for their phone that would be great. Thanks, Positive: product is cheap compare with others in the market. Image and video quality are okay.Negative: wifi features along with app connectivity are bad. Disconnects for no reason and is hard to manage. Sometime it will disconnect from the app but you couldn't work with it manually, unless you give it a hard reset (disconnect the battery). If you want better quality and connection I suggest you go with a GoPro., This item have been open before arriving to me . It box was without its brand new warranty seal, it is very shame why is happening it ? . It is lack of respect to the costumer;  please., Very poor quality overall. Picture, sound, stabilization are all not very good. After reading the other reviews that were positive, I don’t know if I even had the sam camera. Used it for a few hours and tried to be positive. After that, I returned it and got a Go Pro and I am so much happier., This camera came with so many amazing features and accessories! I love how great the underwater camera quality is and that it comes with two rechargeable batteries instead of constantly buying new batteries. It's super easy to use; my 4-year old can even operate it in the pool. Definitely recommend., My wife and I really liked it. For this price to be able to get a solid camera was really clutch! We went on a trip to DR and used it for a variety of adventures and I’m no camera guru at all. Can’t wait to try it for extreme uses., Used camera in and out of water works great the handle on camera needs to be longer to help stabilize the camera shot, Use this for my motorcycle. It does the job for cheap if you're looking for an action cam. 1 thing I would advise is to stock up on extra batteries. My daily commute is approximately 20 minutes and when I arrive, battery is near empty already. Maybe it's my settings(?) Not bad, just expecting a bit more., It works great! Sound is quiet if not connected to the iSmart dv app., Battery life last less than 90 minutes. Screen turns black when you are recording, so you can't see what you are filming. I wouldn't recommend it. I thought it was good at first but for longevity it isn't worth it. If you only plan to do 30 minutes between charges then it is right for you., I'm very happy with this camera. It comes with two rechargeable batteries, several mounts and a water-proof case for underwater footage., I picked this up for an up and coming trip as my primary camera failed after about 17 years (canon). I realize this isnt expected to perform on still photos as well as an SLR but i figured it would do as well as my cheap phone. It doesnt. Still photos are blurred no matter how they are taken. If you use them for thumbnails they are fine but if you plan to take stills of your trips do NOT use this as you will be very disappointed. The remote works. The \"water proof\" case is more like water resistant on the low end. Drop it in the tub its not going to protect your camera in my testing. Also the accessories everyone raves about. Almost all of them are useless outside buying more parts. They have a pamphlet that comes with the device you have to register to get the \"good stuff\". I refuse to do this because it means more spam. It borders on misleading. Anyhow, good low end, cheap and second camera ok for primary \"action\" video but nothing to write home about., good camera for price  def worth it just wish batterys lasted longer, OK here's my review I've loved the camera for since I purchased it and have taken many beautiful videos however, I just discovered that there's really no way of editing it I'm not sure why that is I expected it to be just as easy to edit it as a go pro but it's not.  So if you wanna just look at the videos that you shoot without editing  them it's a good camera takes great pictures but for me without the ability to edit it's basically worthless. I downloaded about 6 different editing software apps on my phone and none of them will recognize the video file.  It would be nice if the company that makes these cameras addressed this issue., - Price is awesome! Won't give me a heart-attack in case I lost it while having outdoor activities.- Camera is small and light enough to be attached to wrist- Camera is water-proof and operates well in water- Images and videos are stable and good quality for this price- It served us well in a recent rafting trip to Yellowstone and more ski trips in the winter., The camara stop recording for not reason and When it was recording you can not watch all the videos. Only a few. And the others video shows error, My son and I started using the AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports Action Camera Ultra HD Waterproof DV Camcorder 12MP 170 Degree Wide Angle yesterday and he had an absolute blast with it. Picture quality was great!  Unfortunately, as we were charging it this morning, the charging port pushed directly into the camera and was shaking around inside! We were able to unscrew the front of the camera and remove the charging port. It looks like it was only attached with two small tack welds. I emailed the company (through Amazon), but Amazon responded that there is an issue with the email address the company provided.  I didn't expect this camera to last forever, but I did expect the charging port to last more than 24 hours!, The camera has one of the worst picture and sound quality I've seen., Our gopro got water in it and ruined, so we wanted a replacement without spending so much money. This is the same size as a gopro...pretty good quality video. It came with 2 rechargeable batteries.  We also got the accessories which are a good cost and have so many options. If you do not want to spend a lot of money this is a great option for you!, It’s works great. My only problem with it is that I was recording a thing for my school and it would suddenly freeze and the only way to fix it was  to take out the battery. Apon further inspection, it would freeze whenever shaken too harshly., Finally got to use my camera on a scuba dive. But didn't really use it cause it leaked and is now not in my return window! Super disappointed!, This camera has ok image quality. It has a short battery life when recording, only about 1 hour. It does not come with a memory card.Rated 3 stars because of the short recording time/ battery life., Image quality for the money was good. Image stabilization not good. Good camera for the money, This camera ruined my motorcycle trip to morocco.  I was hopeing to get some footage of my motorcycle trip.  This camera would not work for me.  It continually froze and would become unresponsive after less than 5 minutes of operation., Nice little action cam for the price. Takes good video. Sound is not the best., Really really poor camera and sound quality. Waste of money to be honest. Bought to record vacation memories and aircraft takeoffs and landings. The sound quality is the worst., The video quality is just ok. This is a case where you see 4K and think its gonna be great, then you get it and its just OK., It is a small camera and I like that. I can take it with me wherever I go if I need it. I like the battery. And is easy to take pictures and video but I don't like too much the picture quality and color balance. All depends how you want to use it., Unfortunately I haven't been able to use this camera but twice. The battery says charged but when I unplug from the power source it shuts off. The buttons are confusing. Manual was no help. I was really excited to get and use this camera for my horse back riding but guess I will look for something else., This is a great alternative to trendy GoPro cameras. It has all the features the kids are looking for for sport videos and more., Good amount of accessories and quality seems as good as the GoPro., Not a bad camera just not was i was expecting. Having a GoPro this doesn’t really compare., After 3 weeks it stopped working.  I returned it for a full refund and got myself a GoPro Hero 5.  It is working well, and longer than this camera.  I would have kept it, had it continued to work., I actually bought 2. I'm changing my original 4 stars to just 2. The quality of the videos I shot and downloaded are very poor. Not the quality of my work! But from the camera. From both cameras. When I first noticed I went and shot with the other camera. Same thing! It's very disappointing., You get what you pay for.... video is extremely jumpy. Picture doesn’t even seem to be 720p., If you want to record your bike rides, this camera is NOT a good choice. It doesn’t have any image stabilization., Image is not clear, not 4K, This camera is easy to use and takes really good clear pictures. I've used this during hunts and for other random things. Great camera., Before I could use it for the third time. The clip that holds the buttons in place. The one for the power. Came off!! No it's useless under water or in salt air conditions!! Not happy at all!!! It was a week old at best!!, A little shakey when running but overall it's a nice camera for the price, Great videos, but the battery life is goes quickly., The battery didn't last very long - a couple hours at most.  The plus side is the camera comes with two rechargeable batteries so I was able to replace it when it died.  Video quality was good, picture quality left much to be desired.  I could've taken better pictures on my phone.  Sound is almost non-existent when in the water proof case.  It comes with many accessories that I couldn't figure out and the manual was no help.  Tons of accessories but not one selfie stick which is really what we wanted.  I bought this for a trip to Kauai and it served its purpose.  If you're looking for an affordable option for a vacation I recommend buying this camera.  If you're looking to get more usage than one trip, I'd recommend investing in a better camera., Great Color. But battery only lasts about 30 minutes., Quality seems very solid, has gone on a few kayaking trips so far and the waterproofing is up to the job.  Video quality is really good although I'll admit I haven't spent any time testing its limits as far as fast action or low light conditions.  I'll probably buy a few more, I have a Gen 1 Gopro Hero and this easily meets the same quality plus more features., Just check the video for yourself! This is a recording of the Audio/Video Sync Test available on YouTube that I recorded just minutes ago. I have emailed Akaso support. I'll provide an update once I hear back., The charging port no longer works, seems the fins in the actual port bent over?, Great value on the dollar., Got this for a trip to the USVI and got some great moments with it, This does not include a needed micro card., I purchased this item thinking it would be a bargain deal that's comparable to GoPro. They're incomparable and I wished I would've spent a little extra for a much better quality GoPro., Like how portable it is yet provides great quality videos, Great for the price. However, it only takes good video and pictures in high light. Low light settings look terrible. Definitely not 1080 p., Video quality is very poor. Cannot be use for anything proper. Phone take a better video, Just bought this for my daughter’s birthday. She will be using this on our vacation this summer!, I bought this camera as a good alternative to the name brand rival that is 5 times the cost, figured what do I have to lose, it’s only $75. I was actually pleasantly suprised that the video quality above and under water is really good. Then I downloaded the software from the app store and was wondering why it has so many bad reviews and barely a 2 star rating. After installing it I attempted to transfer some of my videos from the camera to my phone and the app would crash on any video that is longer then 1 minute in length. Also the downloaded videos remain with in the app and can’t be saved to your stream. In conclusion the iphone app is very poor quality and if you don’t mind removing the SD card to copy the video to your computer then this camera is a good buy, otherwise if you want to use the app on your phone and to transfer the video footage to your phone over wifi I would not recommend this camera or this brand, Image quality and stabilization is bad. Returning the product., Doesn't work properly as expected some time it turns on some time it doesn't battery were fully charge this item sucks, Really easy set up, Works Great!, I used it in my car to capture the back roads and the battery life is a lot shorter than another action camera.  Used it once ride and returned it just because of battery life., Nice action cam but they could do better no stabilization at all, No instructions included but did come with a good bit of attachments, It’s okay... I bought a memory card. When I video the screen blacks out after a min. There were bubbles on the screen when I opened it., I liked the camera and had good picture., Unfortunately the cover of my battery broke and now I can’t used, I wish they would include in the description somewhere that this camera does NOT include audio! Only photo/video. Waste of money for me.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The laptop arrived just in time for school!! Works great., Product description very much lied about the keyboard being backlit. Pretty pissed about that considering it the reason I chose this laptop over others I was looking at. Otherwise, it works fine for the basic little wprd processor I use it for. Also, not a cool design like any online description of the model. This one is straight flat black. Incredibly plain-looking. And one of my keys is at a wonky angle, but it works. Considering the ither asus products I own, this one falls short, honestly.If you want to take it out of S Mode, go to activation and choose to change your edition to regular Windows Home. Its a free switch., Works good.But the keyboard is not backlit.Good buy, if you don't need a backlit keyboard., I love how light weight and compact it is. And the numeric pad as well. So far I’m pretty happy and content with it., I ordered this small laptop for work purposes and general office operations.  So far, it's been well worth the money.  I took it out of Windows S mode.  It struggled (lagged) a bit with Chrome, so I resorted to using the Microsoft Internet browser but it's been fine.  And since I only use it for work (general office stuff), it's done everything that I could have asked....thus far!, The number dial is pretty accurate. Sleek design and very lightweight. Perfect product for the average commuter, If you feel that you need the trifling advantage of the \"easy access\" NumberPad, go ahead and buy this one. If you don't, avoid this one--it's a constant annoyance. Think you can permanently disable the NumberPad? Good luck with that., Amazing product it’s small do you can easily carry it around with no extra weight, For 190 bucks, this is perfect. I think tablets are very overrated.  I only like touchscreens on a phone.  This computer is the size of a tablet, incredibly light.  I just wanted something to do my financial stuff, email, shop and casually browse the internet.  I don't watch movies on my computer but it plays you tube type videos just fine.  sound is a little weak but if I want to listen to music I can cast it to my stereo.  What I like best is the size and weight. Small and light. And it seems to be built solid. I charge it at night and use it off and on all day and there is plenty of juice left. I could probably charge it every other night if I wanted.  I've only had it a couple weeks but I feel very good about my purchase., Screen was good but touch screen sucked...the lol mouse would disappear from screen and just pop up anywhere and wouldnt click on items the 1st click(it takes multiple clicks to get to where I'm trying to go)., It is perfect for my personal use and easy to navigate. Light weight and fits into my bag to carry with me., I like the size and for the price it’s worth buying., small, compact and convenient, Stay away from Windows 10 S ! Let me tell you what it is ..... trash 🗑!!!!!!! You can’t download anything from browser unless is from their crappy App Store! I couldn’t download Sketchup ! This is the worst part you CANT use GOOGLE!!! Like what the F ! They only allow you to use Bing ,who in the right mind uses that search engine!! No oneeee! You have to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to Windows 10 pro to be able to use your brand new computer like a normal person would like to do! Very very disappointed with this stupid “windows 10s” upgrade! (Not even an upgrade)!!!!! Please do your self a favor and buy a Mac !, My wife bought this for email and Facebook essentially. I had to uninstall the Windows 10S features because it kept freezing on the screen that said only approved windows 10 S apps would work.This warning came up randomly even though the only apps on the laptop WERE from the Microsoft App store.Finally I said ok no more Windows 10S and dropped it in favor of plain Windows 10. Since that time there has been no problem and no discernible detriment to the function. It is very small so be advised if this is a concern., ********************************** 07/24/2021 **********************************being firmilier with windows seizing possession of computers overclocking chip-sets and burning them out first on my listidisabled secure boot and set the supervisor password in bios so windows andits automatic this and automatic that could not inflict further damage to thehardware without firstly obtaining my express permissionnot trusting windows and its most advanced network hacking teqnikesi then proceeded to install my 9 GB linux clone in 10 minutes flathowever i needed windows to register this new computer sos i started windowsafter setup finished without a internet connection it said theres nointernet conection try this troubleshooterwhich arived at the decision that i needed to reset the router (NOT TRUE)  duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhbut why win 10 was updating at chip sizlun full throttle thats the true reason  out of pure curiosity i let this rogue os update it took a full day and a halfbefore i could use edge browser to register in my asusand by the way my last laptop used to do the same thing everytime itupdated until i**************************************************************** disabled the automatic updates  ** by setting the ipv4 gateway address to a bad address ** and unchecking ipv6 protocal  ** in the network configuration dialogue  ****************************************************************2 words braught the micysoft madness to a sqeeky halt********  GRUB-INSTALL *********the wifi chip is a realtekRTL8821CE---the cpu temp is a cool 100 degree farenhite after waking from a nap---and under your control linux will run your chipset at 108 degrees farenheightat idle with bluetooth radio on---in linuxvbox windows 98 running the yamaha SYXG50 soft synthysizer which by the wayrenders the dsp effects in software on 12 miditracks laden with yamaha sysex register 20% cpu utilizationand 117 degree farenheit cpu temp and play hifi music without hickupthis vm cuts the battery life to about 9 hours---also the battery has about 19 hours of secure browsing in it using 2048 bitencryption over bluetooth connect---intense usage such as simultaniuos remote desktop and ssl secure browsing bringtemp to even 120 degree and battery life is 1 hour per 10 percent battery capacity---running linux headless and radio off give you &gt; 40 hours of batteryapache2 server + file sharing + encrypted ssh is on---in linuxthe 14 inch keyboard is backlighted up for your pleasure and for due reasonit is almost impossible to see your key in anything but direct sunlighthowever this is a much needed feature regaurdless  A very usefull feature on the extended keyboard is the well placed home and end keyit follows the standard template for laptops except there is one more row on the far rightwhich has the following keyspower buttonhomepage uppage downendFN*******************************************************************************linux xcfe desktop uses about 1.1 gig of memory out of the installed 4 Gigwith 6 virtual desktops and 5 different apps running*******************************************************************************the charging cord is 6 foot loong and she charges up from 50% to 99% in &gt; a hour*******************************************************************************the integrated video tops out at 1920x1080 and bottoms out at 320x180and refresh rates vary from 60 hz to 120 hzthe battery life sinks exponentialy with increased resolution and refresh rates, I just wanted something simple to use for files and meetings. However, the webcam is awful. The image is poor quality and if you move at all you will be one big blur, so I will need to buy a separate webcam to use. The key clicks are loud as you type, and although the number pad on the mouse pad is a nifty option, it will come on and off when you don't intend it to. Overall, not bad for the price, but the high rating seems to be misleading. Not sure how much I trust Amazon reviews at this point, I saw no mention of the poor quality webcam and that was one thing I noticed right off the bat considering how prevalent Zoom is nowadays., Worked great out of the box but would not turn on the next day.  Shame as it was perfect for my needs., Quit working after a week, It has M.2 which supports NVMe SSD.soldered RAM, works pretty fine to me. I buy it for my daughter and it have all thing that she needs., Perhaps I goofed or something, but even a live boot wouldn't take., It is not user friendly., Well worth the price. Small long battery life. Enough capability to support remote learning, Cheap Chinese garbage, So far the L210 slim laptop is good for working on projects and would make a great investment for a highschool or college grade laptop. Had to make a couple adjustments like uninstall the graphics driver and install the intel one because graphics problems with chrome as well as in chrome disable the \"use hardware acceleration when available\" setting because of graphics errors caused. the other adjustment made was creating my own power plan because with the one that comes pre-made for it doesnt do the laptop much justice. basic power plan was 4-6 hours on battery but with a well setup plan have it setup it can do 6-10 hours with videos and 10-12 hours on everything else from browsing web to having multiple programs running. some stuff you should know is the graphics is 2gb which can handle 1080 videos easy depending on your internet speed. 4gb of ram and barely any is actually used unless you have alot of programs running at once. the processor says 1.2ghz dual core but the speeds that have been running are  1.8-4ghz so far depending on whats running. doesnt get too hot when running games or videos so wont get burns when sitting a your lap. 1 thing tho is that it is listed as having a backlit keyboard but it does not have one. After dealing with windows updates and driver updates theres around 20-25 gb left of space available so if you decide to buy one of these laptops make sure to get a micro sd card for it so you can expand the space and i recommend 120-500 gig., Works good, fast, light weight., Outside of the mouse pad \" I like it a lot.\", It's been more than a month since I got mine and about 3 weeks in the touch pad stopped working. Trying getting it fixed by a technician who wants an arm and a leg to fix it. I'm not a fan of using a mouse so disappointment is an understatement at this stage., Remember you get what you pay for. Very slow but for paying bills and very light gaming it is serviceable., Initially I thought I'd gotten one of those rare deals ... something fairly good for a lower price.  I was being optimistic.1.  Screen saver doesn't work2.  When in \"sleep\", you can't always get the computer to wake up - you have to reboot3.  Applications lock randomly - Chrome, Excel etc - initially thought it happened after the laptop had been idle for awhile - but it happens randomly at any time, even when in use.  Some or all app's become locked/unresponsive and you have to close/restart them4. This is more a personal gripe - the sound quality is very poor.  But again, it's a low end computer so it really should be expected - I just didn't expect the sound to be this bad.On the plus side -1.  It is fairly fast and boots quickly, The picture description says BACK-LIT KEYBOARD, but it isn't! Whomever designed the website for ASUS should be fired! I went through a big hassle trying to find an ASUS laptop that actually had the back-lit keyboard that was advertised on several of their models, but didn't have it! I wound up buying an ASUS 14\" laptop that actually had the ADVERTISED back-lit keyboard from Office Depot/Office Max. I had them verify it before I bought it., USPS delivered this today. Big box with a fairly big box (and padding) in it with a small and light laptop in that. I had it unpacked and charging in no time.Since I never intended to ever use the WIN10 installed on it (or even boot it) it took a bit to figure out how to get into the computer settings so that I could boot from a USB drive that I had Linux Mint installer loaded on.A WORD OF CAUTION for those that are going to install Linux - the current popular install .ISO's don't have the drivers for the WIFI chip! The drivers will have to be installed manually. Bluetooth does however work and I was easily able to link this computer to my iPhone and get out to the internet that way.WORK A ROUND: I ordered a cheap (~$20) \"TP Link\" USB 802.11N (only 2.5Ghz) Wifi adapter, plugged it in and it just works. Maybe someday Linux will have drivers for the built in WiFi chip in this device.While the only CPU'S that Intel makes that are crapper than a Celeron is a Atom I found this on the web:\"The Intel Celeron N4020 is one of the most budget-friendly and power-efficient laptop processors. ... As for gaming, the Intel UHD 600 graphics of the Celeron N4020 is one of the weakest solutions. It can be used only for the lightest games.\"To sum up the above, it is a very cheap and uses very little power.For its size, the keyboard and screen are ok. The keys have good travel. It has a matte screen.This is a small and very light computer. It is 'snappy' enough surfing the web and running Linux native applications. While I'm not clear on this but it appears that it can be charged with a standard USB-C charger.I'll have to take it out in the wild to see how the battery life holds up on it. Running Linux the battery should last as least as long (or longer!) than it does while running WIN10., I bought this laptop to use for leisure travel this next year.  Wanted something bigger and more useful than the tablet I currently have.  While I have just started the setup process, ie loading my apps, files, etc., it is doing exactly what I wanted it to do.  I've switched to Windows Home, installed all my apps and it's currently updating Windows.  It is showing lots of promise!, This was a MAJOR selling feature for me since I work nights. Description needs updated., It's fine otherwise, but the trac pad stopped working a few days after we started using it., Recieved yesterday.Still reading info on using micro soft...... I'm use to Google use but this lap top has much more to offer IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET USE TO IT.., Purchased this laptop in March 2021 and it only lasted six months with light use. One day I could no longer connect to the internet. Ran the troubleshooter and it said it could not find a network adapter. Tried everything suggested, but still can't connect to the internet. Total waste of money!, I am giving this tablet two stars as it is inexpensive (under $200) and lightweight, other than that I would give it one star.  I should have read the description more carefully as it is not a touchscreen model.  Get your fingers to work on the touchpad if hard enough but the way this was designed if you aren't very careful you are constantly turning on the numbering feature.  It is a serious stupid design.  You have all the number above the alpha keys. Grab a calculator if you need it.  I waited too long on return it., Excellent for just information support for your job, 365 micro soft is useless, For the price you can’t complain it works for basic usage as browsing the Internet. I would recommend for anyone who needs a laptop with basic functionality ., Easy to use, up in a second.  I love it.  Then I realized that I couldn't hear a damn thing.  I'm on a computer 12 hours a day, I know how to work them.  I adjusted the controls...blah blah.  Could barely hear the volume on some things, particularly YOUTUBE.  Finally looked and lo and behold, the speaker are on the bottom. How in the hell can speakers project when you have the danged thing in your lap?  My thighs completely block all sound.  So in order to hear certain things, I have to hold it up to my face.  Yes, I've trouble shooted everything. Yes, I know what I'm doing, and Yes, I'm sending it back.  SOUND SUCKS and I don't want to have a little speaker attached to the top so I can hear., Perfect for what it has been designed for: internet browsing, music, playing videos. can play Terraria, Arrived without windows bootingUpon boot enter BIOS and I get “no bootable device”. You can tell the manual has been beat up. When filling in return on Amazon I find support phone number but despite being advertised as open nobody answers., I dislike the confusion with it's programs. Not one to be a \"refresher\" on..after so many years!I feel I made a mistake with choosing this.., Laptop is smaller but has everything you need for school and very light so easy to travel with overall good computer for price, Sound stopped working completely after a week, It won't turn on after having it led than 30 days, What I expected, It’s cute, and quiet, but the screen is made in a way that you HAVE to look at it at a certain angle or it feels weird on your eyes and only the center circle is bright while the edges appear dark.  I’ve never hated a laptop screen so much. It’s almost like it has a privacy screen on it., Well it really wasn't what I was looking for. It's kinda slow, and I really couldn't get too many good apps on it. And it seems much smaller than what it's size is supposed to be., I wanted this laptop to do only one thing - act as the control for a label printer, but it couldn't even do that. It took forever to boot, and everyday tasks kept crashing it. Totally useless! I returned it as soon as I could get it to shutdown., This computer was a great purchase for my son. He likes to play Roblox, Minecraft and Steam games. This computer has the capability and speed to play these games and plenty of room to hold them. It is not a gaming computer but is capable of playing these games without too much lag time. The touchpad that moves the mouse icon does like to stop responding to touch but simply press the F6 key to toggle it back on and off and it will start working or plug in a mouse. The battery lasts an extremely long amount of time. The display is very clear and good quality. Excellent product for the price. The seller, Lucky Trading, has excellent customer service and was very helpful with communication and when I needed product support. Highly recommended., I only needed the computer for zoom.  Whenever I touched the mic I had to hit it several times to turn on mic to speak.  It was a pain so I returned the computer.  I prefer touch screen &amp; a larger screen., It took about ten minutes to download Google Chrome, and when it did, simply opening a new tab on the app took at least two minutes for it to fully load. I bought this laptop to use for writing and schoolwork, but the speed was just unbearable., Much smaller than I imagine but was ok. Easy to carry around, fast enough for my use., Dislike nothing! I use it for work  l like that it was easy to use, It's a laptop and it does laptop things. If you need it to do heavy intensive things, it might not do the things.But if you keep your expectations low, you'll probably not be disappointed., The size and range of motion is pretty coolEdit: the family safety automatically being turned on is irritating. The dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. I’ve taken some mins to set the computer up I don’t want to spend more time, Screen might put some people off. Battery is phenomenal, it’s silent, and the audio is fine. Perfect for on the go.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bought for school work. Doing good so far.Sleek., It's alright, I bought this laptop a week ago. The touch pad worked at first. Once, I upgraded Windows 10. The touch pad stopped working. I went to the Acer site, to download a new driver for this pos. Of course it didn't work. That's why I'm giving this a bad review! I've tried several things to fix this laptop. None of them worked!, My son loves his laptop, One of his favorite devices so far.. One suggestion by memory card to go along with this laptop, I purchased this for my online college classes and am so glad I did. Awesome product!, This computer has totally inadequate volume.  The return was readily accepted by the seller but when I actually took the computer into the UPS store, I had to pay $21 to have it shipped WITH the properly printed return label !  Never had to pay to return an Amazon purchase before!!!!  What a ripoff!!!, Best laptop for this price, 5 star, I love everything about this laptop!, Horribly horrible computer! Do not buy! Screen went out in less than a week! Only used it once or twice before it went to H E double hockey sticks to, The trackpad has scrapes in it when I got it. Returned it, it's been two weeks and I'm being told it will take another 2 weeks for my refund to process. The body is also thin plastic and not metal like some other aspire 7s, including the trackpad. Get another gaming laptop, the ROG zephyrus g14 is on sale at best buy right now for almost the same price with a better GPU &amp; CPU and an all aluminum chassis., Basically the one thing that turned me off is that it warns you not to download the Google browser because it may make it unstable., This will be my last Acer. I expect notebooks to last around  3 years and that is when you actually use it. I used this one as a spare and hardly used it at all. In fact I just found it does not even have a battery that you can take out. I would not recommend this product., GREAT little laptop. Performs well. I do mostly work on it (Microsoft Office, Audio editing on Audacity, minor video editing and some music composition with Sibelius) and it runs flawlessly. Occasionally I travel and play games on it (league of Legends and World of Warcraft) and it runs those just fine too (WoW on lower graphics settings). only down side to this machine is there's VERY little memory. Make absolutely sure you budget for cloud storage, or an external hard drive if you go with this machine., Not nearly enough RAM, slows up with just basic web browsing, This is a great laptop for the price, but the worst thing about it is the placement of the touchpad, it's on the left hand side below the keyboard, which makes no sense.  It should be centered or more on the right.The screen color is also a bit bright, so if you want to edit photos on here beware of that.  Also this thing is kinda heavy., This is not bad, but I would not buy it again. The speakers are horrible and under the computer. making it hard to hear (I am deaf) and you have to pick up the computer to hear them. The cap lock key does not a light on it let you know it is on. Drives me crazy. No CD Rom either.  :(, Love this laptop except why would you put the speakers on the bottom which makes the sound horrible?  At least make the max volume higher so you can at least hear without needing external speakers!, Initially, once I set everything up, I was pretty pleased with my purchase! But after a little over a month (and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month), the screen went black but the back-light on the keyboard was still on. So, I figured it just needed to be charged. I left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it. Still, lit keys but no screen. So I changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more. Came back to it, same thing. I tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference. I never took it out of \"S\" mode, and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs. Basically, just checked my email a few times. Now when I plug it in, nothing lights up. The adapter on the charger doesn't have any indicator light to show that it's working, so it could be a faulty power cord.I'm going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers. But in any case, a brand new device should last longer than a month.Now my return window has closed so I'm either stuck with a $350 paperweight, or I'll have to search online and buy a new charger and hope that works..., I do not spend a lot of time on the computer. I purchased the computer so I could do some personal writing. I like the fact that it had Microsoft Office installed. I did not like the the restriction to only use apps provided through the Microsoft store.  To download other apps, like zoom, I had to disable the Microsoft security system, which cannot now be reactivated on my machine.  But as far as general use of the computer, it has been great., Unfortunately, I have to write a bad review on this one. I have babied this laptop and while it was a decent for cheap laptop, I can't believe it just died on me after 14 months. I didn't get a warranty because the price was more than half of the laptop cost...again, inexpensive laptop. I expect slow, etc. but not death., Easy to set up, liked the keyboard. I added another 4 GB memory.  Just a nice overall laptop., It is a lot smaller screen, keyboard, etc., than I had before.  Though I had an Acer Aspire before.  I don't like it, probably will return it, and wouldn't recomment it for older people., Nice laptop for the money. I still don't like Windows. Battery life is lousy, My lab top has quit working. It will not restart it is froze &amp; my mouse will not work it won’t let me do anything, For the price point its a great laptop. First I added another 2GB RAM for under $20 and upgraded. Before I start with the positive one big negative. When the laptop goes to sleep mode, it take 25-40 sec before it wakes up. It's very strange. Its not a traditional hard drive. I didnt change any settings. I have to hit the power button and literally sit there for it to turn on. Pretty annoying. Other than that screen quality is phenomenal. Speed is more than adequate for MS office apps . It can also handle streaming and 8-10 browsers at a time.  For school, work , anything non hardcore this is a good laptop. Sound quality I aways use my bluetooth headset anyway. Sound is bit more towards the stereo sound. I am sure that can be adjusted, just havn't played with it.Like others have said, you cannot go wrong at this price point. I just hope it lasts and dont bog down or slow down with updates and what not...., this laptop is giving me nightmares. the touchpad is super sensitive to \"accidentally\" turning off. ok, fine. restart and it's back to normal if nothing else works (forgetting the inconvenience). then this morning after an update to windows 10, the touchpad isn't simply off. it isn't in settings, there are no drivers, it's just effing gone. so here i am, using a mouse i hate, because the laptop basically doesn't work as a laptop. take into consideration when thinking about purchasing this model. it's cheap, yes, but if you actually need to use on the go or in your lap, it's a bad choice., I purchased this laptop for general purposes as well as using the Cricut Desgin Space for my Cricut machine. My old laptop was just running too slowly and I needed an upgrade. First off, the price is amazing, and I'm fully aware that you get what you paid for but I feel like I got MORE than I paid for with this. I don't know much about specs and the ins and outs of computers so here are some pros and cons from a general user:PROS:- The look and design is very very sleek- Fairly lightweight- The screen resolution - AMAZING!- It seems fast so far- The battery life is very good. I've been working continuously for about three hours now without it plugged in and I still have 1/4 battery life left.- It does come downloaded with Windows 10 S Mode however there's literally a sticker directly on the box directing you to a website that explains a STUPIDLY EASY four step process to permanently get out of S mode. It was the first thing I did (based on other reviews) and have no issues. IT WAS FREE TO DO AND TOOK 2 MINUTES!!CONS:- Caps Lock/Num Lock do not have an indicator light. I'm already finding this very annoying but I use a USB keyboard most of the time anyway so it's fine.- The sound is awful. If you're using this laptop for streaming, games, etc. you will need headphones. No seriously... it's really bad. The quality is okay but it does not get loud AT ALL.Overall with a couple of days of use I'm impressed with this!!! Purchase ASAP if you're looking for an affordable general use laptop :), I bought this laptop for my wife for her job. I wanted something not pricey and just something that worked. I saw the high amount of five star reviews and I read through some of the lower starred reviews and thought, that won't happen to me, BS!!First of all, the computer got shipped quickly and got here undamaged but that is the only good I can say about it. The backlight for the keyboard goes off quickly and you have to press a key to turn it back on instead of moving the mouse and you cannot change it. As you may have read in other reviews, the computer comes with Windows 10 S Mode installed but my product key is not genuine. It says that the digital license is not valid. Because of this it WILL NOT ACTIVATE WINDOWS. Which means I CANNOT TAKE IT OUT OF S MODE. If the computer is in S Mode then you cannot download any apps or programs that you would normally use like Mozilla or VLC or even Chrome. And furthermore, you cannot access the Command Prompt which means you cannot even activate the Windows even if you wanted to.I have contacted Microsoft who told me that they could not do anything and to contact ACER. I contacted ACER and they told me to try one single thing, which I already did and confirmed that it does not work, then told me I had to send in the laptop to the techs which would take another two weeks just to get it back.Sooooooooooooooooo, long story short, it is a never ending loop of disappointment, anger and resentment and a complete waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE., This laptop was overpriced., Screen quality is decentTouch screen not reallyThis isn’t a gaming laptopTurn off the wifi so it doesnt interfere with your cell phones connectivity or other tablet/computer., Overall, a great laptop for the price. I added 8G of RAM really easily. It is fast and cheap. However, some technical issues:- S mode is horrible. Got rid of it immediately.- My powerpoint screen recording function would not work. Called Microsoft and they were very helpful. They rolled back my display driver to Microsoft Basic and worked perfectly, but then the computer would not recognize my second screen. Called Acer, and they told me they didn't have another display driver to download and referred me to a third party (Answers By) that wanted to charge me $99 to fix the issue...- For some reason, the internet was really slow. Played with two different routers I had. It was still slow even with a tri-band router and no other devices connected to the internet. Then, I connected to the guest wifi I had set up and it worked perfectly. I suspect this may be a driver/software issue.For the price, it is hard to beat this, but get ready for some compatibility issues and no support from ACER..., THIS PC WAS GOOD BUT THE CAMERA DID NOT WORK I OPENED CASE THEY COULD NOT FIS IT  POOR PRODUCT SUPPORT DOD NOT BUY THIS PC  DO NOT BUY THIS PC. VERY POOR SUPPORT FROM AMAZON AND ACER, Product wouldn’t work out of the box, and after an hour with tech support made the decision to return., I love everything about this laptop. Especially the built in Alexa. It's so sleek and stylish. My daughter told me it looked just like her MAC laptop. Best buy anywhere for a laptop at a reasonable price with all the features!, Arrived late, Speaker volume is low.great LT for price! Won’t find anywhere else., Stopped working after 4 months of light use., The first time I attempted to use my webcam for a important Zoom interview, it would not work. After Acer did hours of trouble shooting, with no resolve, they told me I had no other choice but to reset my laptop to factory settings, which meant I lost almost everything I had on my laptop. When it was determined that losing all of my content was for nothing, they finally checked the device manager and discovered that no Webcam drivers had been installed! They then told me that I would have to pay to send the laptop back to them for repairs! I refused to pay out anything more. Needless to say I Will Never purchase from Acer again.!, Hard Drive crashed after 7 months and it was going to cost more than the computer to fix., Product arrived on time and was as advertised.  No surprises., Nothing special about this. Recent buy, no issues thus far. Appreciate the graphics card vs the \"newer model\" with the integrated card. Helps with some lighter games and other graphics-intensive apps., Horrible product. Bought it in March and it keeps disconnecting from the internet, sound is absolutely horrible. Now I have a laptop that is absolutely useless., It will not stay connected to WiFi - I constantly have to reconnect to wifi even after just a few minutes of inactivity., Everything is good for the price but  the volume  is to low... l had to return and get an apple instead. Even though it is double the price., This is a nice laptop for the price.  No issues so far at all.  I did need to take it out of S mode in order to install Zoom which is basically mandatory these days., The batter life is trash, and heats up fast, I bought this entry level Acer as an extra to have around and wasn't expecting much for the price.  Everything about this computer is very good EXCEPT for the low volume of the sound.  I'm not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume. I wasn't expecting BOSE quality, but I was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100%; it isn't.  Here's what I did, checked drivers, opened the Realtek to confirm all were set at 100%.  Upon researching other reviews, I noticed similar low volume issues; it appears that this is where Acer skimped. (I have an entry level Toshiba that has horrible quality sound, but it is loud.) I need to Blu-tooth an external speaker just so I don't have to bring my ears to w/in 8\" just to hear.  Of course, it doesn't help that Acer put the speakers on the bottom, yes, the bottom of the unit. It's a shame that Acer did so much right for the price, only to mess up on a incredibly low volume!  Would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100%?  The answer to my rhetorical question is no, but they did anyway.Overall, I would have given the unit 4 stars, maybe even 5, but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3, at best, unfortunately.My take-away is that I won't buy another Acer without hearing the sound first., built in camera and mic not working, Computer works well. Still trying to learn the operating system as it is different from the last computer., Worked fine for 13 months of occasional use, and then out of nowhere, the motherboard failed--just outside of the mfr warranty window. Piece of junk!, I absolutely love this laptop, key board lights went out and i am a senior citizen with eye problems who runs a help line to get services for families trying to get moms into recovery and am limited in times i can help to day times when i can see the keys, Microsoft edge is the worst browser first off, secondly this laptop did an automatic update and deleted several of my saved documents which are unrecoverable- hours of work are lost. It also blanked out 4x during a timed midterm exam last week.I have had this laptop for just 6 months - sad to say, I won’t purchase Acer again., I purchased this product based on many reviews .  After waiting 30 minutes to set up this thing, I called Acer support.  This thing would not set up Windows.  There is a 22 digit serial number that has to be provided fast and you have to use a telescope since the type is very small and is located no where near where the tech said it was.  Am going on 3 hours now to fully set thing up and am about ready to send it back.  Pure frustration.  This thing has all kinds of features but one important feature it lacks is the ability to set it up without having to take 3 hours of your life to do so.  Recommend you buy something else., overall its an ok computer , but the speakers seems damaged, its extremely low and theres a feedback, Computer works great, just as advertised, good value, would buy again, Works exactly how I expected it to and does everything I need it to do. A very good laptop for the price given., I got this for gaming by day 3 the touch pad stopped working. I troubleshooted it for days. Nothing worked. It only works with a mouse. I was very disappointed. I returned this item and will buy a different brand. Really sucks cause I liked it for gaming☹️, I have been very satisfied with this purchase so far.  I've only had it set up for less than a week, so I can't really state how well the battery is going to be,,,but so far it is great.  I have only had one small problem with setting up the email, but I'm just going on my web browser and accessing it from there, not sure what the problem is, probably something on my \"non-thechie\" side of the screen.  It is a great value for the money and I have absolutely no complaints.  The best feature I have found so far is the back lit keyboard....I had no idea how wonderful this would be....it's great.  I used to have to squint or turn on a light, but not anymore.  It's really an amazing little labptop and the screen is crystal clear.  The speed is very fast and so far I am loving this laptop way more than the last 2 Hewlett Packards that I have had to replace due to faulty battery setting.  I love this computer., Works like a charm, Keyboard start to having pressing issue after a while. Specially the one you use most. Otherwise it’s a great computer, I bought this computer for a new full time remote position. The computer is great for VERY BASIC NEEDS. Only a couple tabs open and browsing the internet. I needed to have 10+ tabs open and be able to toggle back and forth very quickly for my role and this computer could unfortunately not keep up. If you need something faster, I would get the same computer but with an i5 processor for $200 more. Well worth the difference. Have had the new computer for a week and it runs remarkable faster and can keep up with what I need done.Also, I plugged in a bluetooth mouse to this computer, and once I unplugged it, I could not get the touch pad to work anymore, so it is a good thing I am returning it as it also had this alternative issue., backlit keyboard is nice, but I hate to have to pay for word processing.  I hate this \"Gortana\" which pops up all the time., it is a cheaper computer that does its job.But the mouse pad thing doesn't work anymore. so I have to use a external mouse, This has the potential to be a good computer, but Acer ships this in S mode. Windows 10 Home cannot be activated. Running SLUI 4 will open the installation ID, but Microsoft cannot activate that number.  The agent said I needed to call Acer.  I called the toll-free number included with the computer and was told by that agent to call Microsoft (whodathunk?) or send it to Acer to be \"repaired.\"  It was out of the box for ten minutes and they wanted it to be repaired! Thanks to Amazon-- it is being returned.  Run  Away., I purchased this computer for my small business job. Within two weeks of use, the down key came off. Amazon's response is to glue the key down, which is ABSURD. You can't just glue a key down, which I explained, but they said that is all that they could do. They would not replace the computer., I purchased this laptop for school / social media / youtube / browsing &amp; i absolutley love it. No complaints so far., It’s really good I actually got it two days earlier than they said they were going to send it to me which that is great, Not lasting more then 1hr! And lagging when you unplug the cable., Still working on this. Hope to up my rating if we can get things working. First experience with the system was very positive. Issue is that on day two I saw a message in the lower right corner of the screen: \"Go to settings to Activate Windows\". Settings says \"We can't activate Windows on this device because you don't have a valid digital license or product key. If you think you have a valid license or key, select Troubleshoot below. Troubleshooter says \"Something interrupted our troubleshooting.\" Called Acer support and was told they would mail me Windows Installation USB memory stick. Waited a little over one week and asked for status update. Was told that USB install media was not available, and I should contact Microsoft for activation. Entered last four digits from activation error message and was told I would need a new product key. Contacted Acer support again, and was told we would need to return the computer to the factory for fix; which could take 15-20 business days, plus shipping time. Briefly considered returning to Amazon, be decided to try the Acer service option. Will be awhile before we get it back., The physical device is very nice.  Lighted keyboard good EXCEPT no indicators for Caps Lock nor Num Lock.  That is unfortunate (what, Acer saved $2 to not include two little leds). Bluetooth non-operating out of the box so will need to troubleshoot.  Touchpad stopped functioning after a few weeks - another thing to troubleshoot...  Hope that is all the bad stuff that happens to this new machine., We got this as a grad. gift for our grandson. Great price, great laptop &amp; fast delivery!!, Flimsy.  Returned it., Finally unboxed this laptop.. have not used much but the charger that came with it is not original making me think it's a refurbished laptop advertised as 'new' or sent a used one.. will update this review when I've used it a bit..if I don't return it..., It very light weight but not very fast. Screen quality it’s good., Purchased this for a high school kid. Does what it needs to do. The base model is ok. I like that you can upgrade this in the future. They included the bracket for a secondary drive. I will be buying more of these for clients, Works well for school Wish I had read I to description more No sd card or disc reader So cost wasn’t as well as I thought after buying external  readers, Windows does not run as smoothly on the Acer as it did on my Dell. My games do not work as well. Have to refresh page often when searching on internet. Not happy with this product., Can’t complain about an Acer product for the price and quality!, I live everything about it except the battery lifeI constantly has to recharge it to appoint i just kept it plugged most of the time, A good performance., To summarize, you get what you pay for. I was not expecting to run into so many problems right when I took this out of the box.1. Immediately I heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when I pulled it out of its packaging.2. The sound is so bad it's like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store. The speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality.3. Loud fan when it gets a little warm when using.4. Scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs. I had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos I noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs.5. Customer service from both Acer and Amazon makes it difficult to fix your/my issues. I contacted customer service the same day after I received this laptop and also the day after. After telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to Acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed.6. Possible restocking fee. Wanting to return this item, even though I barely used it the first 2 days, customer service told me that I cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it BEFORE they can tell me whether or not I will be charged a restocking fee. If you don't like being surprised by restocking fees, don't buy this laptop so you won't have to return.7, I was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem (basically to spend more money just so I can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file.8. Screen quality is definitely not good. I would give it a 6/10. The color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor, the difference is super noticeable.9. 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me. You would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you're basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usable.I know this has good reviews but don't be fooled by it. I was swayed when I was going through the reviews but after I got my product, I was highly disappointed. I wish I had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop. This one is not worth the regular price. I would say with the issues and quality of this laptop, the price should be around $250., Works fine.  Sound could be louder., I tried 3 of them they perform differently from each other and they appeared to have different hardware suppliers internal parts made by random manufacturers for example M.2 port is only PCIE X2 speed  and advertised internal sata3 port performs about 300mb write and 500mb read on a drive rated 530mb write 550mb read.Over it looks as if it was put together in a hurry debris around plastic body can easily can cut hands skin etc., This laptop is great and I had it for months, but when I first got it I had to pay another 100 dollars to take s mode off of it., The computer itself is great for basic use (checking email, browsing the internet, writing papers, etc). I bought it because I have a MacBook and most Department of Defense websites aren’t compatible with Mac OS. My biggest complaint is that 1 month into owning it, the charging cable doesn’t seem to work anymore and I’m terrified for the day that the battery dies and I have no way of charging it after that., Not good as described. Not hapoy with battery performance., It's a great laptop sometimes it can act a bit uppity but just restart it if you just installed some apps. Also it comes on S mode which you can change to regular windows 10 for FREE!  Go in settings &gt; application &gt; Switch to windows 10 mode, Good laptop but ended returning, found one better., Cheap laptop.  You get what you pay for.  No hard drive.  No cd player.  Mouse board difficult to control., The product key on the laptop was bad and so I could not activate it. Acer customer support was horrible, told me if I had bought it directly from them they could have given me a new product key but since I bought it from Amazon I'm pretty much on my own. Last time I buy this brand., Machine is a really great budget machine. I got it for my wife for school but more than just a throw away machine. In the standard form, it was nothing great. Adding more RAM woke it up a lot. Better overall performance.The back-lit keyboard is huge plus for working at night. Screen resolution and clarity is great as well., I had to return my laptop after the mouse cursor had mysteriously quit working after 3 days of use. While I am used toto Apple products, I tried troubleshooting my Windows laptop, even tried restarting in Safe Mode to troubleshoot, without resolve. I even performed Windows Recovery. Still, no resolve. Confused, I thought, That’s okay, I am within the allotted time to return my laptop. So, I requested a Return and opted for a new replacement (vs. refund). I was careful to ensure I remained in compliance with the Return Policy as set out by Amazon and followed the instructions, step-by-step. I downloaded the RA# and UPS label provided and used it to return my laptop as instructed. The following day, I checked the Amazon website for status of my return, only to discover that all information about my return mysteriously disappeared! I didn’t think much of it as more than a temporary technical error, as it was admittedly nearing the deadline for return. Having carefully followed instructions per Amazon’s Return Policy and with my Proof of Shipment Receipt from UPS, I was confident it would work itself out. NOPE. Evidently not. More than two weeks later, NO REPLACEMENT, NO REFUND, NO RESPONSE. …NO COMMUNICATION. And, Four to Five text messages later to the Seller (via Amazon website) — along w/ submission of my proof of shipment receipt and tracking# — STILL NO RECORD OF iNITIATION OR TRACKING OF MY RETURN. The History of my messages to Amazon / Seller and my Return Request are also *POOF* GONE!What the $&amp;@! NO PHONE NUMBERS; Just the runAround.Apparently, I am now out $500 — AND a laptop. …Fabulous.KNOW THE RISK!, This laptop is 14\"!!! I'm soooo angry!, This laptop is great, its affordable and have a bunch of cool features. The only issue is that it is extremely low. you definitely need a headset or speakers. I have to lift the device to my ears to hear if I dont have any of these available.  I have had it for a year and so far so good., I love it.  Easy to work with, screen is small. whole computer is really a tiny bit larger than a notebook, but the processor is fast and all.. I thought i was upgrading, but i have to wear glasses when using this thing to see the letters., I HAVE ORDERED FOUR ACER LAPTOPS FROM AMAZON IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND LOVE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE BUY A FIFTH ACER LAPTOP, AFTER READING ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS ONE. THEY WERE WRONG AND VERY MISLEADING. I SHOULD HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, THEY WERE ACCURATE. THIS ACER LAPTOP WAS THE WORST, SOUND SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE, YOU CAN BARELY HEAR IT EVEN IF YOU TURN IT UP TO THE MAX, THE MOUSE PAD AND KEYS WERE UNRESPONSIVE, CAN'T ADJUST THE SETTINGS, ETC. I USED IT FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY MINUTES,..... 30 MINUTES  AFTER I CHARGED IT AND I PUT IT RIGHT BACK  IN THE PACKAGING.  I COULD NOT GET IT OUT OF MY HOUSE FAST ENOUGH.  WITHIN AN HOUR, I CALLED AMAZON FOR RETURN AUTHORIZATION TO PICK UP THE LAPTOP THE FOLLOWING DAY.  I GOT MY FULL REFUND, AMAZON'S EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE SAVED THE DAY.  GREATLY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS ACER LAPTOP. BUYER BEWARE., Cons:-over heats-speakers are horrible can barely hear videos (had to install an additional app to make sound louder)-computer lags a bit (shouldn’t lag for the price of it)- not recommend for the pricePros:-Good quality when watching videos etc, I like everything about this computer EXCEPT THE VOLUME-YOU CAN BARELY HEAR ANYTHING ON IT!, dislike the teeny hddlike I can throw an external drive on it and am gtg after taking it OUT of s modenear perfect for my needs and decent price, Not touchscreen as was advertised in the question and answer section. The graphics are so so. Worse than my last Acer. Overall 4 stars., Good computer. I’m using it to create elearning.When I tried to remove the computer from Windows S mode, I realized that the computer did not come with a product key. What this means is in order to remove S mode, you have to buy Windows Home or Pro and use the product key to remove S mode. I wish they would have just told me that! I contacted the company via amazon chat, they said I needed to contact the manufacturer. They gave me a phone number. There is a button on amazon to contact the manufacturer as well. No success.I ended up just buying the downloadable Windows home version and used the product key to remove S mode. I also purchased the microsoft software for powerpoint, word, excel, etc.That's a lot of drama just to be able to download things to my computer. Just know that you are buying a bare bones computer when you purchase., Was a great computer until I had used it twice for Zoom and now the speakers no longer work.  If I figure out why I will update., When I first received this laptop everything seemed great, I was very excited to set it up with my personal information and get going-- I very quickly realized, however, that this computer was EXTREMELY slow for my tastes.  Even with no background programs, simple tasks like opening file explorer or a web browser took far too much time.  In my opinion, a brand new computer should be opening programs almost instantly, not leaving me waiting a few seconds or more.  This is ultimately preference, but I'm sure there are many more laptops out there for a similar price point that would run much faster.  Returned this after only a day or so of having it and ended up with another laptop from the early 2010's and it runs much better than this one., I had this laptop for about 2 months now and I'm loving it so far. It's lightweight, sleek, and the backlit keys are great for me in my dark room. It boots up in seconds ready to go when you turn it on. I mostly use this for watching videos and streams and excels it that. The only negative that I can think of is the placement of the speakers. The speakers are placed on the bottom and really muffle the sound so my volume is always at max. Other than that the laptop is a great budget buy., Displeased. Some black (looks more like green) dotted lines are running down the middle of my screen. Looks like some kind of defect. The laptop was purchased at the start of September and didnt see usage until about the 25th of September, which means In about two months this situation happened. Was satisfied with my purchase before this occurrence., I’m not sure if it has “touch screen”., Poor quality. Cheap, just like the price. Laptop is unlikely to last you long. Charging port was junk.On the positive side, it is very light and small.If you choose to purchase this laptop, best of luck to you., The battery died after a week and the screen started blinking. I needed to connect an external monitor to work. BAD BAD BAD., I was told I was going to get a new battery sent to me because every since I have the laptop it will only turn on if it is plugged in to the wall and i never received a new one.., very cheesy one , keep freezing ,not able open files or photos , not going waste my time to fight that, I love this laptop. The screen is a great size. It’s light weight not heavy and very sleek., Good laptop, I don't do anything out of the ordinary.  Does what a laptop is made to do.  I stayed with ACER because my previous laptop was ACER.  If it didn't lose the 'W' key function I'd still be using it, but would buy a new battery because unless it's plugged in it randomly shuts down, bad battery. So, the new laptop had a new surprise.  The sound volume is very poor.  Now lugging a wifi speaker along wherever the laptop goes.  I have to not recommend for this very reason., Absolute garbage, I really dont write reviews but when I do I usually make them for the people this laptop is good when it works but I only used this about 10 times and now it does not charge or turn on pretty much got robbed I'm really disappointed I was really hyped about this product but no durability whatsoever no scratch or anything looks brand new and it's a lemon buyers beware., Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop 15.6 inches Full HD computer stop working this month July 2021.  I purchase this item in October 2020 as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  Unfortunately, the computer has stop working and the battery will not charge.  Please contact me in reference to the warranty information.  I would not purchase another computer through AMAZON.  No customer service support when needed., bought this for my brother laid up with back surgery-easy to work great graphics and definitely user friendly!, All ok so far, cute unit--but does not work after two hours =  black screen &amp; deadmay i have a replacement unit?, I love this computer, but the mouse pad doesn’t work. Had to buy a wireless mouse to even use it. But otherwise great product, Good quality, use it to work from home and meetings and classed., I faced several issues with this PC in spite on light usage. First google meet does not work on all browsers and suddenly mutes the conversation. We spent ages trying to solve this problem until we discovered that it works only on microsoft edge.Sound quality is not clear and low.Finally the battery stopped charging and the laptop does not work except when it is plugged in power. All of this happened after less than 8 months of usage.A total waste of money, The product arrived with a bad wireless card. I returned the item and the refund was applied to a Amazon gift card instead of my credit card. I am not happy., I’ve had this computer for a year and for some reason the computer won’t work unless it’s plugged in. I originally got it for college, but the pandemic caused me to stay and do school at home. I haven’t spilled anything or dropped the computer so I don’t know what the problem is., Nice PC but the backlighting went out after 3 weeks and Acer couldn't help me. Having a laptop without being able to see the keys is not good., Bought one year ago, already falling apart. Lacks durability.  Good for a few months, then you'll need a new one.  The input to the power cord is broken and now the laptop won't charge.  The lever that opens and closes the laptop pulled apart. Stay away.  Terrible quality., I baught this laptop and after just a month and a half the mouse pad won't work. Scam, ALL ELSE OK, I regret buying this laptop and spending all the extra money in shipping.I am having two major troubles with this laptop:1 - The laptop slows down and lags badly once unplugged from power. It runs fast and fine when plugged. It's so bad. I have gone to Control panel and under power settings created a different profile for high performance and gone to advanced power settings and set everything to high performance and still the issue persists.I upgraded the RAM to 16GB. Same issue. I have done countless troubleshooting as seen on different websites, my windows is updated. I have switched off most background and start-up apps and it's still same. I just don't understand why I can't have the freedom to use my laptop at high performance when unplugged. This is crazy. I'm suspecting AMD and Acer to be behind this. This issue sometimes doesn't happen but most times it does.2. Second issue is that when connected to hotspot, this device will from time to time shut off internet connection for not obvious reason.So I could be in the middle of an important zoom meeting and off she goes.Don't buy this if you want peace of mind. The back cover also is inferior plastic., Considering I had a Toshiba laptop for over 10 years with no problems, I expected better of this. But two months into it the touch pad and cursor died. Fortunately I still had the wireless mouse and keyboard so the laptop is still functional.I don't have the time or patience to fool around with a return. When I buy a product I expect it to work. We'll see how long it lasts., Track pad broke within 1 month of use. Amazon was no help., Extremely happy with this. I have a laptop i can take on the go for long business trips even upgraded the ram to make it even better. Glad i found this.</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                     I’ll admit I was very skeptical from reviews but I decided to purchase anyways…. and so far so good! Battery life is about 7 hours of constant use (games, videos, etc). Sounds is good. I had no problems connecting to internet. The border of the phone did appear to have some scratches but not too many., The phone I received has a loose charging port that should have been replaced. It was at 27% just now and I plugged it in and opened an app. Now it just gave me the under 20% notification so it’s obviously struggling to keep the cord in place., No working well can't download any apps horrible phone My old Android works better than this junk. Please refund money. Diana Manuele, It’s for personal and the battery life issues is crazy it’s only take 2 hours, Worked slow, barely charged., Battery life is not good at all. Only last an hour., The worse I never bought. Battery is dead and I sent it in Africa, so no way to return it. Just lost my money. I could give 0 star, I’m very picky with my phone cases which means I keep buying them until I find one that’s jut right. This phone case has everything I’m looking for. It’s not to bulky and has a slim fit. It’s enclosed and has a built in screen protector. The front plastic trim doesn’t cover top and bottom front of the Like some cases making the screen “appear” smaller.The rubber is stiff and durable and not like those cheap ones the stretch out over time.One reviewer stated they had to keep taking it apart to get the moister out. Well this is NOT a waterproof case and if it was it would be heavier and bulkier. I’m wondering how that much moister is getting in ther in the 1st place. Are you bathing with it? Tip: instead of drenching the phone with cleaning solution then wiping it up, try spraying the cleaning solution on the rag itself (just enough to coat it) then use that to clean the screen.Another reviewer stated the back falls off. If you don’t snap it in correctly this will happen. Solution: go to an arts and crafts store or fabric store and ask for some double sided hem tape. It’s very thin and extremely strong. It will keep that back on if it’s a defect., Phone broke a little after a month. Was only given a small % back on return and was never told why after multiple emails. Do not buy!!!!, Phone appeared to be flawless when it arrived. It stopped recognizing any sim card after 3 months. even though it was a few days out of warranty when it died the seller still took it back for a full refund., Too small in size, The phone looks great. However, the battery life was 70% instead of the promised 80%. This means that the battery dies very quickly, even when fully charged. We attempted to contact the seller but received no response. We would have settled for an exchange, but again, no response. Looks like we have to buy a battery, add another $50 to the price to get a fully refurbished phone. Very disappointed., Hey- it’s an iPhone. I did have to buy ear buds for this unit as none came with it.The phone is OK, but the battery is horrible., GSM does not work. This version of IPhone cannot be repaired. I stop being able to update, because it does not connect to the local network. It is WITHOUT SERVICE ... that is, now it helps me to connect only by wifi and to listen to music ... Battery drains from 100 to 0 in 2 hours of use  The battery is at 50%? I mean, impossible to use it. Lousy purchase They should withdraw it from circulation to these iPhone 7, Phone came in on 86 battery life and touch screen doesn’t like to work, wouldn’t recommend this phone., phone works great, but battery needs replacement, per the iPhone settings screen, just over 3 months after purchase. Does not hold charge for long even with all settings optimized, not using GPS in background etc. Otherwise price was reasonable., The phone battery was supposed to be at 80% or better but this battery only 77% and Apple saying need to replace battery now. It's too bad vendors don't install new batteries and increase the price because changing these batteries is not fun as you can have screen damage and broken wires. Aside from that very happy with phone and fast delivery., Good condition, but instantly overheats when charge. Not sure if that’s normal but the body of it great condition, This IPhone 7 gets really hot as soon as you charge it . Also it charges slow ,, The phone is unlocked no scratches , no flaws . Came right on clear. Packaged for fragile item very well. My daughter loves her new phone., It is hard to buy from a third party and it not working is frustrating., My review is half bad and half good. It came in almost a week, which I was crazy waiting for it. I was so happy when it got here! I checked the battery capacity and it only charges to 62, which was so disappointing. It charges really fast, but loses a lot of percent quick. Other than that everything was good. It came with a charger and charger block., I ordered from Trademore to get a refurbished iPhone 7, and it arrived fully ready to go out of the box with the latest iOS version installed. All I needed to do was add in my SIM chip and sign on with my Apple ID, and iCloud Backup restore did the rest. The unit I received works like new and was actually flat (as opposed to some other refurbs I've had); it had some scratching on the glass, but not over the actual display area. Trademore and Amazon refurbs may seemed more expensive than refurbs from elsewhere, but it's worth it for a great unit with no hassles or technical gotchas., It took a while for this to become an issue. At first I was restarting the phone which I thought was fixing the problem but the proximity sensor does not function properly. As a result, when I attempt to talk on a call, the screen remains lit and the side of my face continually hits the buttons, resulting in frustration for both me and the caller. It's impossible to hold a voice call at this point. Unfortunately, by the time I realized what the problem is, the phone isn't eligible for a refund., Easy to use, I got my iphone 7 opened it was fine owner didnt factor reset it i turned it on an it was on home screen.Works well i like it!! 8/10 😃, batter health was at 70 not the promised 80., Bad phones you are not honest, I bought this for a July gift.  It stopped working 8 months later.  It would no longer receive a cellular signal.  It took about a week to troubleshoot with the mobile carrier before they said it must be your phone.  I took it to a phone repair shop and they said the motherboard crashed. 😩, So I got this phone, when it originally came, it had more damage than what was listed so I returned it. The next one that came in had little to no damage so I was excited. However, after the 30 day return window (of course) the phone has been having all sorts of problems. I have audio issues with my phone on speaker, the keyboard gets stuck constantly, and the battery life is pretty much non-existent. Incredibly pissed I bought this for 230$ and now can only get 60$ if I sell it back. Just a warning, but if you buy your phone from here you are gambling with your money honestly. So just do a payment plan through your provider or get it from apple and spare yourself the frustration, Died every 20 minutes and constantly shut off and if it was colder than 50 degrees it would not turn on., I’m disappointed with this phone’s battery life. I have to make sure I keep a charger with me everywhere I go. This is my first experience with an iPhone so maybe that is how they are, I don’t know., This was in good condition and battery life good., Seller guarantees 80% battery. Received phone with battery capacity of only 75%. Seller never replied to follow up messages and only offered a $20 credit and never replied when alternatives were requested., Bought this refurbished iPhone for our daughter.  We like the parental controls that Apple offers.  We aren't going to buy her a new expensive phone so it is nice to get a used one from Amazon., Overall good product! The cameras kind of glitches at times but it overall works. The battery dies very quickly, but it works perfectly fine even without a sim card. Very good product!, I just got this  for my middle school son in time for school to start. It needed charging upon arrival, but the charging cord/plug that came with it did not work. Luckily this  is a replacement phone, and we have other chargers in the house and so were able to get it charged.It's working so far. I can't comment on battery life yet because it's too soon. The phone appeared to be in excellent condition., Overall satisfied with iPhone 7 transaction: the phone arrived in pristine physical condition--I could not find a scratch on it.The battery however had 78% capacity, not the 80% advertised. Not sure it would have made a difference as this phone was for my 12 year old son and in the end I decided to replace the battery (which granted is not for everyone as it's not a 5-minute process - more like an hour and 44 minutes process).Was able to successfully change the battery and all is well. So, net-net was able to get a like-new iPhone 7 for under $200.Recommend this vendor but do know if you are not comfortable swapping in a new battery you'll be charging your phone 2-3 times a day as normal phone usage will deplete the battery quickly., I like everything I don’t dislike nothing, Fine, I like is because it was a easy set up and everything was good on it, i have to go to apple because i got this phone for verizon and it wont let me make calls or texts sooooo basically dont buy it, I was pleasantly surprised after reading a few not-so-good reviews ... but the iphone 7 (Verizon) that I received looked like it was brand new.  It was packaged very nicely in a custom box with a new charging cable and AC converter.  Not a single scratch on it, \"battery health\" was rated at 84% and everything worked perfectly.  Frankly, I can't imagine why someone actually traded this in for a new phone????  But I'm glad they did.  My daughter (currently my Tech Support person) was sweet enough to get me a very nice \"Youmaker\" protector for it ... she knows I'm a bit clumsy.  I've only had this phone for a few weeks but so far so good.  I even use it for visual control (FPV) on a few of my quads/drones ... it is remarkable how well the battery holds up for that video on 10-15 minute flights ... much better than my old iphone.  Very glad I bought this., Runs slow , colabirtation is off and screen glitches, Battery life is insufficient and less than expected., Phone came fast and everything is good but the battery only holds a charge for about an hour when it’s not charging pretty annoyed about this., Bad battery life junk charger, just buy new instead of having to do it anyways, Home button non functional., Wasn't bad came in good condition., If I can fit everything I didn’t like about this phone into this box I would detail it.But whoever replaced the screen did a horrible jobWon’t register any SIM cards to any carrierIt looks like I bought it from wish.com, There’s a black line when trying to take pictures, takes horrible pictures, The phone is used and it doesn’t earphones, Everything was great. Like brand new!, Like many, read a lot of bad reviews... Was worried that there would be major issues upon getting the phone. HOWEVER, my phone showed up next day, SUPER FAST. Opened up the packaging and the iphone 7 looked very very good. Couple very tiny scuffs, but was expecting such as it is a USED phone would give it a 9/10 and i'm picky. Called my phone provider and they were able to switch it to my number no problem. I have sprint, which has merged with t mobile. I got the FULLY UNLOCKED phone, for anyone wondering. After running the phone through all its tests, everything is in proper working order. Battery life is at 84% which is fine by me. Higher than the stated number of 80% anyways. Never really payed attention to that stuff on the other phones i have had. All i can say is that the phone is doing everything it should and I am very happy with it. If there is one concern, the phone may be running a hair warm, but nothing to seem worried about momentarily. I will update this post at any point in the next 6 months if need be, but so far so good. COMPANY I WENT WITH: TECH EXCHANGEE NY, screen had a small crack and a chip  and the back has some marks on it and the home button is difficult to make contact. however the phone does work., Cord does not work!, This device only worked for 6 months and it started decaying. I send it to apple and they stated that it will need a new motherboard., This was for personal use the phone has been nothing but trouble since the day we got it. Will not make calls or will make calls on its own we don’t even when we’re not even trying. Need to know if there is insurance on this purchase Or is there any kind of warranty on this purchase, Item came without a charger, I have been using my phone for about a month, from what I have been able to assess so far the phone has been working properly, the battery holds fairly well, unless playing a game on the phone it drains the battery pretty quickly. The Siri function, the finger print unlock, and camera are pretty amazing, and they are some of the many things that I did not have on my iPhone 4...so this is a wonderful upgrade for me!, Very average product! Must have been used for couple of years before reselling it. Battery life was at 80% when arrived. Good purchase if one wants to buy iPhone at cheap price, Phone works great i have to say no problems so far 5/5, Have this phone just over six months it glitches, turns off all the time, battery drains fast, phone won't shut off even when the battery is at 98%.  The amount of money I spent on it I should have gotten more than 6 months use, wouldn't recommend., The phone  barley work can’t call nobody can’t text nobody, Why it dies so fast ?, It’s ok, It’s a good phone over all but often freezes or hangs up calls on its own. Dies very fast! Annoying., The stop working in 2 weeks, Extremely scratched and banged up. Shouldn't have passed quality control. Unless the standards are that low, Perfect condition, The battery on my other phone was only lasting me from 7 am - 1 pm so I figured I would get a new phone - The new phone is lasting from 7 am - 11am and says the battery is 100% healthy...., Worst purchase ever don't waste time on this item does not even turn on turns mad hot 1st day on arrival does not turn on 2nd day return hopefully all turn out good with money back update later on, Phone has no signal, Antenna broke internally on phone within 4 months just outside the 3 month return window.  Worked great until then., i liked it except for the fact that the back had some dints in it and u can’t turn it on silent mood, Look good, Speaker are not working, Arrived a day early which is usually nice, but I planned my schedule around it arriving on the estimated delivery date. It had obvious wear on the back and there was a small blotch on the screen that must've been dead pixels or something because it was pure white regardless of what was on the screen. I didn't like it in this condition, so I returned it and they said they would deduct return shipping cost from my refund but they ended up not doing that., The phone I received did not have a working microphone. Couldn’t record or make calls. The company issued me a full refund. They have great customer service but sold a faulty device so I gave a neutral rating., Honestly I was so nervous to buy a phone from Amazon for the 7 year old stepson ... but reviews can be very deceiving .. phone worked GREAT !! Now if I can only get this 7 year old to come back to earth and stay off the phone lol needles to say he loves it ..., The phone doesn’t work. I can hear a person I call, but they can’t hear me., I loved this phone for about a half a year and loved it! However, I got a message saying my SIM card could not be read. Turns out that this is a known iPhone mistake when iPhones are built. When I brought it to the Apple store they said that because it was originally made in Japan they could not fix it or send me a new one. I am now out for a new phone. However it worked very well when it did, I just wouldn’t risk it., My battery dies way too soon. The package also arrived much later than expected and also had a decent scratch in the screen deep enough to affect the overall appearance. The camera works just as expected but it definitely was not the “new” look you can definitely see the precious wear and tear on the iphone., No work for Verizon, Great phone thank you, i was confused by the packet  i received with item, it said iphone 5s - i was ready to return(im a new iphone user) i was kinda disappointed with charger not working - had to buy additional one to use phone - overall its a great item -, The phone was very nice looking phone, but I had to return the  phone due to it was not compatible with my sprint network service., The phone constantly restarts itself. The battery lasts all of 10 minutes. I do not recommend buying a phone from this company.. they’re junk., I've only had this Iphone 7 a few days. The reason I bought it is because my previous Iphone wouldn't hold a charge for more than a few hours. So far this Iphone will hold a charge for 2 days with moderate use. I'm happy with it so far. The charger that came with it did not work but I still have my previous Iphone charger that did work. Other than that I am happy with it. It didn't have any scratches or anything and looks brand new., This review is for the seller Hybrid IT. First of all, I wasn’t expecting it to come as fast as it did. I ordered my phone Friday at 3 AM and received it Saturday by 12 PM, that’s kind of insane since they are in NY and i’m in FL. There are a few small scuffs on the bottom of the device near the speaker but otherwise it’s pretty close to perfect cosmetically. The screen has no scratches at all, i can’t tell if it’s the original but if it was replaced they did a hell of a job. The max battery capacity is 100%. it came with a charger but no headphones or headphone adapter so you will need to buy one. i haven’t experienced any issues so far but it’s only been a day so i will make sure to come back and give an update.Also if you have Metro by TMobile and you’re having trouble getting service after inserting your SIM, you have to register the phone with them before it will work, not sure about other carriers. for a second i thought i received a locked/stolen phone but i wanted to make sure. don’t give up unless the carrier actually tells you it won’t work. you can try calling the customer service number and doing it with the automated system or a representative but if you don’t have access to your old phone you need to go into the store. It took 5 minutes and only costs $15-20 depending on where you live.Overall i’m extremely pleased, it was a risk but i’m happy i seem to have gotten a good device. Thankful for all the reviews recommending to buy from this seller., The maximum capacity of the battery was on 74% when I received the phone. I can only use the phone for a few hours before the battery is completely dead. Other than them sending it with a bad battery the phone works great., DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!! I got this in today after looking for a good phone for my son for about 2 months the home button didn't work and you can't use Verizon it is not Amazon renewed its a scam, Phone is ok, no marks or scratches, but came with outdated ios that needed to be updated prior to transferring data from old phone.  Battery life isn't great., There are times when a phone is set to support another carrier, and even after a full factory reset, any carrier update will kill your mobile network.  Happened to me.  Sprint/T-mobile reset it and tried multiple times, and every time we got it to work, it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a day.That means no calls, no text, no internet if you're outside of wifi.Be warned and keep your old phone handy.  You may be disappointed like i was., Every renewed phone I’ve gotten before this one had a renewed battery. This one did not. Will have to get one soon, phone charge only last a few hours. Would not have bought it if I would have known the battery was not renewed., ok, It was good phone till a month after purchase kinda salty about it still wish i didnt spend on the phone also did not come with the right charger, I like the condition of the phone. It really looks as good as new.The problem is on the earphones plug. Should provide the adapter., The phone was ok. I had a few issues but nothing major., Gof a great product. Fast response, Phone worked great for about 6 months. Then it stopped connecting to the cellular service. Trying to update it and the phone says that I can’t. Called Apple support and they can’t do anything since phone is no longer under warranty., Everything was good except the battery came to me at 80% capacity.  So when it charges to 💯 it’s never better than 80%.  The seller offered me a 20.00 credit but I can’t find an authorized dealer to change the battery.  🤷‍♀️, This phone is almost perfect!!! The only thing about this device is that I can’t get it turned on due to the fact that it won’t accept a SIM card. I found this misleading due to the fact that they told me my device was renewed and compatible with certain carriers., Nice piece, My son loves it. Arrived quick, looks new, & works great! He’s been smiling since, Received the phone in the usual blank white box refurbs come in, shipping was fast and it came with an android charger block and a no name lightning cable.Phone came with one long deep scratch, a cracked home button, and a couple other much smaller nicks and scratches, enough that it was off putting for me. Battery life showed 92% which is excellent however the phone did seem to lag after only my second week with it.Phone was unlocked as stated and I had no issues switching in my sim and using the phone right away. Overall a decent phone but I will be returning it because of the the cracked Touch ID button and deep scratches, The phone does not work properly it heats up so hot every time we try and use it ., Gift good condtion, A good way to get a new iPhone at a good price, The battery is useless, it takes 3 hours of use to fully recharge, needs to be replaced, All seemed as expected from the seller and from description except battery life was not 80% or above as stated in listing but 70%.The biggest issue with this was having to pay, send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promised.This just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending, then what else are they not checking with these phones., Didn’t come with any kind of paperwork and it’s working but the touchscreen can freeze up at times., Although i was very happy to get a much needed upgrade from my old 5s and this was just the right size there were a couple of things i was not satisfied with and almost sent the phone back. First of all Amazon stated the battery would be able to be charged at a minimum of 80% its original capacity mine was not it was around 75% i figured ok well i suppose i could live with that but amazon also states that there will be no visible blemishes on the phone viewed from 12 inches that was not the case with mine the finish on one of the rear corners about a half inch the entire corner of the phone was completely wore off once again i decided I could live with that since it is the rear and would be covered with the case. Overall im happy with the speed and functionality of the phone though and the screen camera and everything work great. I’m not happy that i will end up putting another 50 to 100 dollars into a phone that cost me about 200 in order to get a new full capacity battery that lasts longer for media and extended use, Daughter loves it, No fingerprints reader and the phone Glitches a lot, I was switching phones because the one I was using had a battery that was starting to die. However this one does just as quickly and got so hot it almost hurt to hold it., I just opened this product and charged it fully for two hours and unplugged it. As I’m sitting here on my old phone to port over my SIM card credentials, the battery went from 100 to 88% within 8 minutes. I just saw the numbers dropping right before my eyes. The phone transfer and condition are really good but the battery is terrible. I wish the guarantee included a new battery. (Health is reading at 83% out of the box)., The phone is very small., BATTERY LIFE NOT AS ADVERTISED  ONLY 56%NO ANSWER FROM SELLER, The phone looked good function well but was defective it had something loose inside and I had return it, I’d definitely buy again. This the real deal fr. Y’all should try them out! I got my money’s worth ., The battery life last about 2 to 3 hours., Great phone, defiantly recommend. It’s a little weird at times like it takes a while to turn on after it dies sometimes and I can’t have certain pictures as my screensaver for some reason. It would black out parts of it but I only had that problem with two of my pictures. Other than that for a refurbished phone it’s pretty good., I've boughten iPhones from amazon before, two different iPhone 6s. This time, I could only find iPhone 7, so if figured \"why not?\". I'll tell you why, this seller sent a defective phone. It worked perfectly the first day, and then 24 hours later it told me I needed to update it or else my cellular data wouldn't work (which means I could not receive or send any texts or calls!). Sure enough, I updated it, and it worked, for another few hours, until it said it needed ANOTHER UPDATE! Unfortunately, it was already up to date as it could be. So I took it in to the \"geniuses\" at APPLE, and they said THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH iPhone 7, YOU NEED TO REPLACE IT. And that was it. Returning, hopefully that goes smoothly. Avoid iPhone 7, too sketchy., excellent product  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It’s thick, but works good once you get used to it!, These base and top coats work great for an at home gel mani-pedi. My only issue was when i tried to soak and scrape it off, it seemed like the base layer bonded almost TOO well with my nail, and part of my nail layers scraped off. I had to take a few months break between the next gel manicure because my nails were damaged. This could just be user error or the fact that my nails are extremely thin. They held up great though, and looked beautiful., the product works great, the only reason i didn’t give five stars was because it smells TERRIBLE. like a skunk almost and it’s very strong. but it works, and works well., I would buy it again. Beats having to use nail polish remover in the end. Best quality I’ve ever used at home. Nails come out looking professional. Very easy to use. I recommend it., smells awful, While the polish is great, every bottle I've ever had from them, 4, ALL HAVE LEAKED when on their side., I love this product it’s very easy and it last for 14 days, Best brand for top coat and base!! My favorite one, Terrible product. The base coat seemed to work fine, but the top coat was in such a gel-like consistency that I couldn't even use it. No matter how hard I shook the bottle up, it remained the same. Waste of money. Only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the base coat worked. All in all, NOT HAPPY!!!, The base coat is horrible. You’re better off just buying the top coat only. Top coat is average I would say. I’ve done my manicures without the base and they come out better. The base causes the polish to look bumpy., Really cool that I can do this at home. Just light and done!, My top coat bottle came completely empty. I am returning for a replacement but it’s disappointing!, Poor quality, was only good the first few uses. Base coat became thick and does not go on smoothly at all. Product quality changes over very short time. Would not recommend. Both me and my sister are allergic to this product. After some use it causes nail bed pain and inflammation., It's great that you take a picture... but it helps if you show the door # !!! This was dropped off at 104!? NOT 106, I could not get the base coat to dry fully.  I used my UV light 5 times (5 min) and it was still tacky.  I gave up and went ahead and put polish over it anyway.  The polish I used thankfully was able to dry just fine.  The top coat seemed to dry much better but I won't be using this brand again., Overall this is a good set. It can be thick so be sure to wipe the brush on the side of the bottle before applying and when covering your nail. Make sure to use thinner coats and apply evenly or else you’ll see the lines/uneven levels after curing.For curing times, I have a UV LED lamp and wasn’t sure how long to cure for. Top coat 60 seconds is perfect. Cures hard and comes off easily when time to remove. For base coat I tried 60 seconds but was having a hard time when removing it, so I went down to 30 seconds and that seems to have helped., Top coat dried out in the bottle after 3 uses. Returned!, Perfect, Bottles came leaking from the top. The gel polish I got to go along with these two bottles was perfectly fine and intact. Why these leaked I don’t know. I haven’t used them yet either since most of the product was all over the box it came in., Top coat goes on nicely and leaves a nice shinny coat and is not sticky., Pretty easy to come because the polish came off within a week. I would have expected it to last at least 2 weeks., Very small but not too bad, Nice, not that good, This product worked amazingly well. After a minute under LED /UV it was dry. Very sheer and worked well with my polygel kit., First time trying this brand and my last. Very, very thin like a refusal polish, not hard at all. Nails broke easily. I do not recommend this brand., Great product, Amazing! Lasts the longest out of anything I’ve tried!, This is a peel off formula. I do follow all the instructions for application and I never use acetone to remove. I soak in water for a few minutes or just hand wash some dishes and I am able to peel of the polish most times I one piece. Now while that its awesome because it removes easily, the manicure does not last past 2 days with out major chipping., I used it the first time and it worked real good! but the second time was horrible, I could not get it to set correctly, it was in a way clumpy? it sucks because I really wanted to like it., Horrible product. Does not stay on. The top coat has a thick glue like consistency and does not spread on nail well. Peels off within a couple of days. So disappointed., Is just a oil, It is clumpy and didn’t even dry all the way through, now my nails are smudged.Está muy gruesa y no se secaron bien mis uñas., I ordered the base & top coat about 4 years ago & I loved it. I started doing my own nails again so I wanted to try it again...bad idea. The base coat works fine but the top coat started clumping & was too thick & this was only the first use. Maybe they’ve changed the polish since the last time I used it but I won’t be ordering it again., Works fine doesn’t last too long though., The base coat good, but the top coat is trash! Starts peeling the next day., Great base and tip coat!! Lasts atleast 3 weeks for me!!, Not even an Ounce, I have tried various steps in an effort to get this polish to last longer than 7 days. It doesn't matter what I do it chips and looks like crap and has to be changed by day 7. I bought this base and top with Amelie gel polish., The topcoat got extremely clumpy after the second use causing an unsmooth finish., I was super excited to get my gel polishes in with such fantastic ratings- unfortunately the product was so thick when i went to apply, it applied like a literal paste.  There is no good use for this polish and I would like a refund promptly., I love the no wipe too coat. Saves me some time., This brand doesn’t hold up, the shellac peels off a lot sooner then expected., seriously soooo good! i do my own gel nails/toes at home and this is by far the best set i’ve gotten. gel polish is definitely an art and takes a long time to master - if this set “lifts” you probably just aren’t doing your gel application correctly. these two are excellent! also added bonus you don’t need to wipe the top coat :), The item itself is good but the bottles are very very tiny. I wish they made them a little bigger for the price., This does what it says it will do and the top coat is not sticky at all when it sets. The only complaint I have is that if you try to close the bottle when there is polish on the brush and the polish gets onto the mouth of the bottle, the cap will actually shrink wrap onto the mouth of the bottle making it very hard to open! This has happened to me several times so now I make sure there is no polish on the outside of the mouth of the bottle and I try to close it very gently not tightly. Please be aware of how you close this nail polish otherwise it will take FOREVER TO OPEN when you want to use it again., I really loved this product for the first few months! But recently began to have an allergic reaction to the product! I'm bummed I have to switch it up now because its great quality. Not saying don't buy it-- but definitely be mindful!, Very good product. Will buy again., applies and cures well, but dulls your manicure significantly. Also the base coat is difficult to remove., Bought for my sister who does nails and she didn’t like it... sadly, I like the product it’s a good shine and it lasts about two weeks I was pleased., The gel has a murky purple coating during the day time. It glows green under UV light.  When comparing this top coat to my Kupa inc Top coat there is a huge difference in color. Kupa inc top coat is clear and the Aimeli has the Murky Purple coating., So in love with this gel. It is thick and gets into all the nooks and crannies. It was actually recommended by a nail tech on you tube (nailed by nikki) and I had to try.  So far I am loving this product!!! If you don't like thick gel this is not for you but trudt you won't regret this buy., Top coat does not wear well. Base coat works great!, Dislike, Great base and top coat for gel nails, Not bad I've ordered it several times wish they would sell a matte top gel with these too, I was scared at first because it Was still tacky after curing under UV light but I read it’s supposed to be so polish will stick. Continued with my nail routine and it turned out well! Really great product especially for the price!!, Great for beginners. Works well, I brought the polish the size of the bottle for what you pay is pretty small I don’t blink your eyes, This chips and peels off, about like regular nail polish.  It is nothing like \"gel nails\" that you get in the salon, which is what I was looking for., Top coat turns yellow after a few days. I have used the base and top coat 4 times so far, and every time my nails start turning yellow after a few days. I have tried different curing times and even wiped the top coat after, but nothing seems to fix it. This has never happened with other brands of gel top coat I have used., Worked pretty good, good product for the price ! I usually get opi but this did the job, This was great for the price. Only issue was it did chip in some nails but that may have been true to operator error, I may not have cured the polish long enough. All in all I’m happy with my purchase. Also, arrived a lot sooner than I had anticipated., This! I can’t even begin! This is an amazing base and top coat my nails lasted! It was easy to use, and great for gels!I love it, This is my first gel base and top coat so I really don't have anything to compare it to., This must be a cheaper brand or the base coat is just bad. I have been using file off gel polish and I was noticing that I have a problem not damaging my nail when filing it off. It wasn't killing my nails, but I figured soak off would case me to do less accidental damage.I bought this brand because it was prime available and somewhat inexpensive. In a week I have had two nails (one on each hand) peel completely off. Its not like the free edge got loose. It just was really lifted in the middle or edge where it frowns in, and the loose polish would get peeled up to an awkward place where I had to remove it or it would peel even more off the top layer of my nails. One happened in just 3 days. THREE DAYS. I fixed those two jankity nails and I also added a second coat of just the top coat to all of my nails after 1 week. I can't tell if the top coat is better or not.Now this does have a perk. Its super easy to soak off and remove. Like wow it removes like butter. But, if its coming off super easy because it falls off of a well prepped nail in less than a week, this is a problem. I can now see why this has some lower ratings and why people would spend at least double on a widely known US name brand. Will I use the rest of teh bottle? Yes. I am cheap! I also like changing my nail polish color frequently if I can pull that off. This soaks off so easy that I could totally change my polish all the time. But, it also just falls off which means when I am too busy to do a manicure once a week this just flat out sucks.Edit: I have updated this review because after sitting and soaking off the polish I am really happy with how my nails look. They aren't damaged or sad looking. It really did just bubble up and off. This wouldn't be my choice for wearing before going on vacation or trying to wear for weeks in a row since it doesn't bubble up and come off easily, but if you like to change your nail color a couple of times a week you will be happy with this polish.8/8 Update: I keep trying this base/top coat FOOLISHLY because I have it. It keeps performing poorly. Polish just pops off within a day or two of application.  Just spend more and get Gelish. Even with shrinkage at least it stays on the nail better. Its my own fault for trying it again, but good grief., Peels easy, This basecoat is whack. Upon applying it, it’s separated like crazy. When I applied my gel color over top it also would separate on top until the second or third layer when it evened out. The topcoat is great, not tacky once it’s been cured and works as advertised., Top coat and base coat is very thick hard to apply thin.  Took forever to cure and was sticky had to put under the led light a lot longer than suggested to cure and then my thumb completely peeled off, This is the worst gel I've ever used. Doesnt really fully harden.  Peels off. Not durable at all. Do not reccommend!!, Not good dont buy this, This item is a great price for the two bottles. And it a product that I like because of the no wipe top coat, and it give a nice shiny finish., Easy to use and has a nice longevity! Impressed with the quality., Not so well, I used this base and top coat with the Gellen polish brand. This stuff works great- top coat is very glossy and dries fast with the UV lamp. Like instantly dry. I’ve had these nails for 2 weeks and the gloss wore off a smidge but that’s expected after 2 weeks. Still hasn’t chipped or lost ALL glossiness. I recommended this brand to 2 friends. Overall great purchase! I will be buying the colors next., I am reasonably new to gel nails and this was my first set of top and base, which I bought as Amazon reccommended it. I am fully aware of how long it takes to remove gel, but this stuff DOES NOT COME OFF. An hour of working at it every manicure with sandpaper, bowls of acetone, and wraps, and it just does not budge. Yet, it manages to lift along my cuticle line after a week and a half. Buy something higher quality and experiment with inexpensive gel colors. Lesson learned., I do like this but do not get to close to the sides of your nail. It will peel up. I can get it to last 7 to 10 days so I guess it's not to bad. Its not easy to take off unless it is peeling up. I am by no means a pro with my nails so it could totally be something that I am doing wrong but for the price it's not a bad product., Great quality for the price. Convenient that you don’t have to use rubbing alcohol after use. My nails stay on really well using the base and top coat. Used with uv light., look nice but the nail polish only last like 4 days., Liked this product and the cost is fair. I have used name brands that have cost more and this brand is equivalent., Bottles were broken at the cap. Bottles spilled out the contents. Was not able to be used. Very disappointed, This is my favorite base & top coat set. I definitely wish that they made bigger bottles or maybe a refill bottle because I literally have to order a new set every week. I go through them too quickly and having the option to just refill my bottle would be so amazing., I really like this base/ top coat but it does leave almost a blue tint to the polish sometimes or it can be streaky., I am new to the DIY UV lamp. This is a must have for UV gel! Make sure your nails are clean and dry before you put the base coat (wiping with alcohol works well). Would recommend and buy again, Not a big fan of this. The base coat never dries (which I know is kind of okay cause it's a base coat) but overall it just takes forever under the lamp. And by that time things like dust get stuck in the polish so it's weird., Was old, Really smooth and shiny but it has a really strong smell, Bought for a friend and she said it's the best she's used this far. I'll stick to the Beetles brand but it's good to know there's an alternative that works well if necessary., good, This top coat sucks. It gets so cloudy and it doesn’t shine, I bought this as my first gel base and top coat. Polish lasted the average two week which was great. However, no matter how careful I applied it, it always left imperfections. Like it shrinks when it sets up under the light. Perfect and smooth going on. Ripples when dried. I tried it with many different colors/brands and always got the same result. I will stick to my new favorite CNC Shellac. Perfect every time, Used it twice. By the second time, the product had already become a useless gooey substance.Waste of money., I work whole day and full time mom and this works great lasts 10 days!, Easy to apply, Received today and not sure if this is oldProduct but I can’t get the top coat bottle open not sure but it’s definitely defective, You NEED the no wipe top for any of their polishes., I use plenty top coat but this is the worst by far, Works great., Pretty nice polish., After using this product as instructed I realized that the topcoat comes off way too easy. I am not happy with it. I do like the builder gel but other than that I do not like this product, My base coat takes a longer time to dry other than that will by again, Love the colors but peels off ez on natural nails, This set is really nice and works well for acrylic nails. Be warned that on natural nails the top coat burns when cured. Otherwise this product is awesome., Trash !!, I love the base and top coat the only problem I’ve had is that the top coat came really lumpy but I’ve been working through it and just wiping the clumps off as I work. But over all they’re both great and last., i love how it goes on----i got so excited i ordered more----but it chips after a few days---am so very disappointed in that---would not buy again----now that i already have!!!, bought it as a result of all them better tthan positive reviews, i was not at all disappointed! definitely recommended with no reservations!, Long lasting, but a few cons. The product is very runny so you have to be careful, otherwise you'll have a lot of clean up around your cuticles to do before curing. I didn't have issues with peeling or chipping until a couple weeks later, so that's a plus. The biggest con for me was the removal. I'm not sure this is really \"soak off\". I soak cotton balls in 100% pure acetone and wrap in foil. After 40 minutes, only the top coat budged.... A little. My gel polish, another brand, peeled off very easily, but underneath the base coat was hard as a rock. This is the same thing that happens when I use my regular gel polish top coat and forget that it has to filed off and accidentally soak them., I love a good base and top coat but I do not want it to be so thick. This product is much thicker than any I have used so far and I had a lot of bubbling on my nail and for these reasons I am passing on future purchases., I've been using these for years. Seems like the formula changed lately. Less shiny, doesn't have the same look under the LED light. Not sure how it will hold up., Top coat was clumpy. Purchased 2 x happened to both top coats, The top coat was not going on well.  I had to replace the top coat with a different brand but I still use the base coat, The base coat works quite well (difficult to remove it though), but after 1 or 2 uses the top coat doesn’t work very well at all. It bubbles like crazy leaving a polka dot texture,  and my nails start chipping after 4 or 5 days of wear. Would not recommend., Functionally decent. They smell atrocious though, more so than any nail product I've smelled in my life. Acrylic smells better than this stuff, it's like burning plastic straight from the bottle. Needs over 60 seconds under UV to set but that's not a huge deal., I don’t know what I’ve been doing wrong, if anything, but the base coat cures in a weird way. It will almost bubble and shrink to one side of my nail. I thought it was my technique or lamp, but I later found out it wasn’t the case. The top coat is pretty solid though, so I’ll keep using that., I was so excited about finding a cheaper alternative to the Sally Hansen brand - but the first time I stuck my hands in any water, the top coat chipped right off and looked awful. Also took a long time to cure., It's cheap, but you should probably just pay a bit more for a better top coat., Nice gel. As expected., Applies well, dries well with my lamp, is no wipe. My only complaint is that it doesn't get thick or strong enough., This product works for maybe a day or 2 but after that it peels off or chips easily. So with that being said it definitely easy to remove lol. Would recommend just spending the money on a better product that might cost more. You will save yourself time!, I've had these for some time now. I do prefer this formula over other brands, HOWEVER, after using for a while, the outside of the bottles gets extremely sticky. There is still plenty of polish left over in the bottle, so I hate to throw it away, but I might have to replace them because I can't stand the feeling. Other than that, everything is great. Just make sure that you keep them upright all the time and be careful when using., This is amazing product., Love this product works great cures in 30secs. Would recommend 2 anyone who wants stronger lasting 💅 nails, Polish started chipping on day 1. To be fair, it may have been the UV lamp I was using because I think it was defective; hence the extra 2 stars., I love that you don't have to wipe the topcoat, but no matter how long I soak my nails… The basecoat will not come off! I have excellent soak off fingernail  polish remover, But the basecoat will not come off  all of the way . I'm going to have to sand it off my nails., Wow! This stuff lasts a very long time, however it took me 3 separate times of soaking my nails with acetone to remove the top coat at 20 minutes each time. I buffed my nails first to scratch it too. It might be easier to let the polish grow out! The top coat polish keeps its shine for entire time. This stuff lasts a long time.The base coat didn't even come off, so I just buffed it off with my nail file.I want to give this a great review, the price is so good, it's just so darn hard to remove. I like the other polish colors, but just will use my other brand base and top coats instead., Polish was awful, it was thick and difficult to apply because it didn’t flow from the brush...it globbed. I did use the curing light-thinking it might kind of smooth out a bit??  and it took 4-5 mins  (supposed to take ONE minute!!)  to make it “seem” ok but it never did completely dry. HUGE waste of my money and my time, The top coat is amazing! I love it. The base coat is weird (minus a star).  You have to put a super EVEN coat on the whole nail and it can’t be too thin of a layer because it becomes uneven. You have to use just the right amount. Anyway, it makes me wonder if the base coat is even necessary. Also, the base coat doesn’t dry hard after the lamp. It’s a bit sticky so don’t touch it. That’s supposedly normal though., I have mixed feelings about this product. The first time I  used the polish it was amazing!! But the next time I used it it was like the top coat was setting/hardening on the brush. I pulled that clump off and then went on it worked just as the first time. But then when I go to use it the 3rd time there is little hard pieces all over the brush. The was no sticky film once you cure it under the light. I just wish I for more uses out of it rather than looking like 3... I've used many gel polishes but this is the first to do this. I may have gotten a bad batch or something. I really like the base coat I have had no problem with the my polish coming off of my nail., Sticky, very sticky, I don’t feel like it is quite as shiney  as previous ones I have purchased, Pretty good.  Once dry there are no problems with chipping or peeling.  But need to take extra time under the UV lamp.  I've used two different brand lamps and both take a while to dry.  So, be patient and you have a great polish., I've used several different base and top coats but when I used this one it started peeling off after 3 days. Nice shine but that's a bummer., Doesnt stay on., Really shiny, easy to use, but for some reasons, it turns yellow after a couple days (3-4)., I've been sandwhiching my my old polish with great success. Lasts over a week, I haven't waited for it to chip to remove.I don't notice any funky smell like other reviewers.I have to say though, the base coat is difficult to remove. I have to do a second round of buffing and soaking to get it off, and still have to buff of the remnants.PS. You have to let your nail polish dry before you put on the top coat or it will never dry!, Will buy again, Leaked everywhere. Such a mess. Had to throwaway., VERY disappointed in this product. I have used a better top and base coat in the past and repurchased those instead. I missed the cut off to return it, but I honestly would. It didn’t last more than a week!, This base coat was unbelievably bad.  It applied smoothly (to freshly washed & cleaned nails that had been wiped clean of residue with alcohol), then as it cured it drew together into raised rivulets, leaving other parts of the nails completely bare. It also went spiky, with little points all over it that gave it a texture like there was sand mixed in. Needless to say, this did not provide a smooth canvas for my manicure, and when two coats of gel polish over it still couldn’t completely smooth it out, my only choice was to put a glitter overcoat over everything to camouflage it. So unimpressed!, Love ,love ,love. Very easy to apply and the topcoat is amazing. Week 3 and no chips on my nails. I have tried many other products,  but this is the BEST.  Highly recommend., TerribleQuality, make sure you are sober when you put it on the first. it's more difficult than regular polish, but it is 100% worth it,  very great colors and it last a lot longer., Base is not good. Top coat does cure pretty quickly but they really don't help the gel stay on longer as my gel chipped the next day. Was pretty annoyed at that., Good quality, very shiny but to little of product, I am glad I bought these but the top coat has been leaking a bit out of the top so it won’t last as long as I’d like but I still am pretty glad I bought it! And the price isn’t bad either!, I love this brand these are amazing, Unlike some name brand's, this product is too soft and allows your nails to tear. And peels off way too easy., It's ok I trying better that keep your nail polish on. More two day sad I have to do my nails very two days cause of product isn't good. Not worth the money., Excellent base & top coat. Makes my nails really shiny and hard and my polish last for 2+ weeks. But it does seem to dent if you push your nail or something sharp into it and for that I’m removing one start. Removal is easy too with a 180 grit file., I gave it 2 star's because the base coat get hard at all so I order a different kind I hope it works better, Bad quality, I use gel polish that does not require a base coat, so I only use the top coat. It dries down nice and hard and does not have a sticky finish. My biggest complaint is that the top coat almost separates, and does not provide an even finish. Does the job, for the most part.  \n",

                                                                                                                                 I was not impressed with the image quality.  Also the app that was suggested to use my phone as a remote for it did not work properly., Biggest pain to attach to a helmet. But works well otherwise., the only thing about the camera was that i had no clue it was so small., We enjoy using this camera to get a canine view of our dogs' activities! It fits well into their harness and we get to see them running, swimming, and playing. There are a large number of function and features, so reading the instructions is a must, especially to take full advantage of the power of this camera. It holds up well to use, we've had no problems with it in several months. Would definitely purchase again!, Not a good purchase, This camera works as advertised and video quality is more than I expected. Great features for the price. The adhesive in some of the mounts could be better. I wish they had special mount for ski helmets., This is a 12 megapixel camera with 4K video. Waterproof case is good and numerous attachments for mounts are included. Photo quality is less than average compared to my iPhone 6s and I can not get videos to play at all. Overall I would spend a few extra dollars and buy a better platform to capture life with., I bought this as a gift for my son, we haven't had a chance to use it just yet. The only issue I've had was inserting the SD memory card. Something seemed to be wrong with the slot. It wouldn't stay inserted all the way in, it seemed it was engaged like it already had a card in the slot. After some time I did manage to get it in correctly. We did do a practice video and took a picture, it has nice quality. We cant wait until the weather warms more to try it out., Bought this for my 9 year old son several months ago. It has been great. Glad we bought it. High quality for the reasonable price and a tough little camera.  It’s holding up well! No negatives I can think of. Works well with phone app. Glad I didn’t spend the extra money for GP. No need. This thing does it all. Lots of videos on YouTube comparing the two. See for yourself., Does not always stay on.I use it as a dash camera., The WIFI system sucks on this camera and the app it requires you to use keep crashing. I found another use for the camera but I would never by this camera again., I love this camera, works wonders for dirt bike trail riding and capturing sea life under water!, Product shipped fast, seems like a great camera so far just recently started using so not sure how to rate long term  yet., Audio doesn't pick up well in the protective case but the video is great. We're still learning to use it but the grandkids have fun recording things., I got this for my husband for a gift, the app didn't seem to work well with his Motorola phone, sinking issues and gave up on it. He has recently uodated to a new Samsung Galaxy 10, so hopefully will be able to get it to work w/it., Good price but takes terrible videos. It’s not worth the time to even save these videos. Look at the videos on the feedback, I don’t know why people think this is a good camera. Don’t waste your time., Very difficult to figure out what parts go to what and what they are used for. If you give them a good review they’ll give you another accessory that you’ll have no idea how to use. NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL INCLUDED. I guess you get what you pay for. I should have checked YouTube before purchasing this. Got it today, returning tomorrow., So far I'm impressed with this product. One things for sure no matter what u plan on mounting it to there's an accessory included to do so. I've only had it for a day but so far so good., doesn’t upload to your computer. Hard to work, This little cam is really good i went to the Bahamas last week and took many under water videos and photos and this camera work like a dream just remember to put in a high speed micro SD card (not included)., I absolutely love this and i have recommended it to all of my friends. I would definitely purchase this again. Thank you, No way that this is 12MP. No. Way! Also (and this was the main reason why I returned it)), the batteries lasted less than half an hour on a full charge. And, for some reason, the only way I could have turned on the camera was if I removed the battery from its compartment and re-insert it., Product works very well.  I use it for fishing and nature hikes. Taking videos hands free is a big advantage. I was impressed with all of the attachment accessories.Excellent value., While the picture is great, it appears that you have to set the date and time every time you change the battery. I haven't found anything in the manual that will save the date and time permanently which is unacceptable. Well I just found it #11. It says \"if you replace the battery, date and time will reset\". WT???????, Disappointing didn’t even work for 30mins in the water and stop working. Don’t waste your money!!!, UPDATED review:(SUPPORT to the Win) After seeing this review, the manufacturer emailed me back, and sent me 2 new batteries no charge, and both were timed by filming a clock, (lol) and both did about 2hrs of run time, of course i ran this once on each. Once summer comes i will pull out the helmet cam and go riding and push the camera to the limit. Advice, be sure to keep the camera outside of the waterpoof case if your riding in the heat, it gets hot with those batteries. Thanks Akaso for the follow upOriginal Review:I purchased this for my mtn bike rides and well it works nice but if you like having to try and time yourself on the trail and at 20 min per battery and only have 2 batteries than well, go for it, its a nice toy. Otherwise ya pay for what you get., The quality of the camera is about what you would expect for $60. It works exceptionally well in brightly lit areas like the outdoors and it also has a wide variety of attachments that make it great for whatever activity you plan on documenting such as hiking, water sports or skating.It's a great entry camera for people who are interested in getting involved with filmography., So I bought this item last year for a Xmas gift, and we are now just being able to use it. And the cord doesn't charge the battery, Works great for its price as well as wrist watch works with Simonides cameras as well great product great battery life, Lots of ways to use this camera. Ordered this thinking it would b great to b able to video our hunting dogs.  We were surprise at all the features it offered.  Must download the instructions and read carefully in order to get the best use from camera., Gave to grandchild.  Loves to show what he does., Wouldn't work for half my trip bought a memory card for it that was ment for the device, kept saying card in valid,battery's lasted about an 1hr, Have not had a chance to give a performance test of it. The box ship in was way to small for the item and it could have (lucky it did not) get damaged. So right now only can say packaging was not good. Will see later this week if camera is any good., It seems like a good camera. I have only used it in the pool so far.  I won't do scuba diving with it until June.The instructins are VERY lacking so it makes it much harder to figure out how to use.Also, I thought it had WAY to many extra parts that I will NEVER use., Very very, complicated. It will take a while to figure out., After opening the box and trying to figure it all out with no so hot directions and diagrams, I gave up and gave it to a friend's son who has more experience with the tech.  So many pieces and it was just not worth it for me.  I never even got it working so I can't judge the camera at all.  So, if you are into high tech camera stuff, it might be great, average user, not so much., It's not a bad unit if you're not willing to spend the money on the higher quality cameras. Bought it for hunting but it's hard to use in a pinch., No comparison to the GoPro.Not many features. No zooming capabilities. I guess you get what you pay for.Update: since posting the above I was contacted by Akaso and offered a partial refund which I received immediately once I agreed to it. Very good customer service., Camera shoots video really well for the price, however the app that goes with it is garbage, This is a good value camera we use for family events. Great price for an action cam, It's a solid camera pictures are ok. But, they look better on my phone. The batteries die pretty quick, I bought this as a second action cam to use for a different angle. The reviews I saw made it look impressive. My main camera is a Gopro Hero 4 so the video and audio quality just doesn't compare. If you were using 2 or 3 of these you could get by ok but this one just can't begin to keep up. It's kinda like a Volkswagen and a Ferrari having a race.One handy item with it that I didn't think I would use in the remote control. For videos, I just don't see much use but for snapping a picture it does \"ok\"., Not what I expected., Did not like that it was not compatible with my laptop or my android phone.  I needed a Mac computer or video editor to down load my videos., Fell off my motorcycle and broke and pieces first time out never got to use it, This product never worked. I took two videos and then it stopped turning on. Being the only camera I took on my trip to Egypt, I was very dissapointed., Takes amazing still shots at 60 fps while traveling at 55+ mph. Do not buy this if you are mounting it to anything that goes down the road. Instead spend a few dollars more and get the Brave 4 which is the upgrade to this model, which includes image stabilization. I can't report yet on how good that feature is on the other camera having bought it to replace this one. However, this one creates unwatchable video, at least mounted to a motorcycle. The image shudder is horrendous. You see some four different layers of the horizon jumbled together when playing back the video on the computer.  On this lower model the remote required the camera to be active for the two buttons to work. They do not turn the camera on. They don't stay lit as an indicator. On the back the lcd is nice, but to determine which mode is active, you have to look closely for the white camera icon to go red, when recording. When taking a snapshot, the screen flickers and resets to the camera, non recording mode. I used this flickering  indicator to know if the camera was recording, while looking through a tinted windshield where its mounted on the front of my bike.The upper model seems to have addressed some of these concerns, for the better. I'll have to review it once i get out on the bike and test it. There is yet another model that is even higher priced than the Brave 4, that one s You tuber claimed had real 4k and not digitally processed 4k like these two lower models, if that's a concern. I had no complaint with the still frame on this camera at speed, set to 60fps, even if it is not true 4k., This arrived with the plastic part that holds the camera to the handle broken.  It worked for the first couple of days, then the charging became iffy to the point where I had to hold the cable titled for it to charge. Then the next day the USB port fell inward into the unit and it could no longer charge.  The failure of the USB port after only a couple uses indicates that the manufacturing of this product is inferior. The camera was returned., Used it 4 times and now it doesn't work. I hope the added warranty is better than the camera., I bought this camera to help record a ski trip with my kids.  The biggest negative I have for it is that the camera is not waterproof.  I couldn't get any audio with the camera because it was stuck inside a waterproof case the whole time.  The worst part is the case got scratched on the lense so now I cant use the case and cant seem to find a replacement., DONT DO IT!!! My husband and I got this for our cruise and the SD card wouldn’t go in the camera. It’s like a piece was blocking it from going in so we couldn’t use it at all. Tried to get in contact and nothing. Spend the extra money for name brand of this is what off brand is like., I appreciate the quality of this product, Just received this yesterday. I have downloaded to apps in order to get videos. One says it download once you go to it you can only hear it. The other one let's you download it but can't share it anywhere because it's only the sound as well. You need a better app for people who only have phones to use. I'm going to try a couple more things but so far not really that great because of the app. If someone could let me know what they use for their phone that would be great. Thanks, Positive: product is cheap compare with others in the market. Image and video quality are okay.Negative: wifi features along with app connectivity are bad. Disconnects for no reason and is hard to manage. Sometime it will disconnect from the app but you couldn't work with it manually, unless you give it a hard reset (disconnect the battery). If you want better quality and connection I suggest you go with a GoPro., This item have been open before arriving to me . It box was without its brand new warranty seal, it is very shame why is happening it ? . It is lack of respect to the costumer;  please., Very poor quality overall. Picture, sound, stabilization are all not very good. After reading the other reviews that were positive, I don’t know if I even had the sam camera. Used it for a few hours and tried to be positive. After that, I returned it and got a Go Pro and I am so much happier., This camera came with so many amazing features and accessories! I love how great the underwater camera quality is and that it comes with two rechargeable batteries instead of constantly buying new batteries. It's super easy to use; my 4-year old can even operate it in the pool. Definitely recommend., My wife and I really liked it. For this price to be able to get a solid camera was really clutch! We went on a trip to DR and used it for a variety of adventures and I’m no camera guru at all. Can’t wait to try it for extreme uses., Used camera in and out of water works great the handle on camera needs to be longer to help stabilize the camera shot, Use this for my motorcycle. It does the job for cheap if you're looking for an action cam. 1 thing I would advise is to stock up on extra batteries. My daily commute is approximately 20 minutes and when I arrive, battery is near empty already. Maybe it's my settings(?) Not bad, just expecting a bit more., It works great! Sound is quiet if not connected to the iSmart dv app., Battery life last less than 90 minutes. Screen turns black when you are recording, so you can't see what you are filming. I wouldn't recommend it. I thought it was good at first but for longevity it isn't worth it. If you only plan to do 30 minutes between charges then it is right for you., I'm very happy with this camera. It comes with two rechargeable batteries, several mounts and a water-proof case for underwater footage., I picked this up for an up and coming trip as my primary camera failed after about 17 years (canon). I realize this isnt expected to perform on still photos as well as an SLR but i figured it would do as well as my cheap phone. It doesnt. Still photos are blurred no matter how they are taken. If you use them for thumbnails they are fine but if you plan to take stills of your trips do NOT use this as you will be very disappointed. The remote works. The \"water proof\" case is more like water resistant on the low end. Drop it in the tub its not going to protect your camera in my testing. Also the accessories everyone raves about. Almost all of them are useless outside buying more parts. They have a pamphlet that comes with the device you have to register to get the \"good stuff\". I refuse to do this because it means more spam. It borders on misleading. Anyhow, good low end, cheap and second camera ok for primary \"action\" video but nothing to write home about., good camera for price  def worth it just wish batterys lasted longer, OK here's my review I've loved the camera for since I purchased it and have taken many beautiful videos however, I just discovered that there's really no way of editing it I'm not sure why that is I expected it to be just as easy to edit it as a go pro but it's not.  So if you wanna just look at the videos that you shoot without editing  them it's a good camera takes great pictures but for me without the ability to edit it's basically worthless. I downloaded about 6 different editing software apps on my phone and none of them will recognize the video file.  It would be nice if the company that makes these cameras addressed this issue., - Price is awesome! Won't give me a heart-attack in case I lost it while having outdoor activities.- Camera is small and light enough to be attached to wrist- Camera is water-proof and operates well in water- Images and videos are stable and good quality for this price- It served us well in a recent rafting trip to Yellowstone and more ski trips in the winter., The camara stop recording for not reason and When it was recording you can not watch all the videos. Only a few. And the others video shows error, My son and I started using the AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports Action Camera Ultra HD Waterproof DV Camcorder 12MP 170 Degree Wide Angle yesterday and he had an absolute blast with it. Picture quality was great!  Unfortunately, as we were charging it this morning, the charging port pushed directly into the camera and was shaking around inside! We were able to unscrew the front of the camera and remove the charging port. It looks like it was only attached with two small tack welds. I emailed the company (through Amazon), but Amazon responded that there is an issue with the email address the company provided.  I didn't expect this camera to last forever, but I did expect the charging port to last more than 24 hours!, The camera has one of the worst picture and sound quality I've seen., Our gopro got water in it and ruined, so we wanted a replacement without spending so much money. This is the same size as a gopro...pretty good quality video. It came with 2 rechargeable batteries.  We also got the accessories which are a good cost and have so many options. If you do not want to spend a lot of money this is a great option for you!, It’s works great. My only problem with it is that I was recording a thing for my school and it would suddenly freeze and the only way to fix it was  to take out the battery. Apon further inspection, it would freeze whenever shaken too harshly., Finally got to use my camera on a scuba dive. But didn't really use it cause it leaked and is now not in my return window! Super disappointed!, This camera has ok image quality. It has a short battery life when recording, only about 1 hour. It does not come with a memory card.Rated 3 stars because of the short recording time/ battery life., Image quality for the money was good. Image stabilization not good. Good camera for the money, This camera ruined my motorcycle trip to morocco.  I was hopeing to get some footage of my motorcycle trip.  This camera would not work for me.  It continually froze and would become unresponsive after less than 5 minutes of operation., Nice little action cam for the price. Takes good video. Sound is not the best., Really really poor camera and sound quality. Waste of money to be honest. Bought to record vacation memories and aircraft takeoffs and landings. The sound quality is the worst., The video quality is just ok. This is a case where you see 4K and think its gonna be great, then you get it and its just OK., It is a small camera and I like that. I can take it with me wherever I go if I need it. I like the battery. And is easy to take pictures and video but I don't like too much the picture quality and color balance. All depends how you want to use it., Unfortunately I haven't been able to use this camera but twice. The battery says charged but when I unplug from the power source it shuts off. The buttons are confusing. Manual was no help. I was really excited to get and use this camera for my horse back riding but guess I will look for something else., This is a great alternative to trendy GoPro cameras. It has all the features the kids are looking for for sport videos and more., Good amount of accessories and quality seems as good as the GoPro., Not a bad camera just not was i was expecting. Having a GoPro this doesn’t really compare., After 3 weeks it stopped working.  I returned it for a full refund and got myself a GoPro Hero 5.  It is working well, and longer than this camera.  I would have kept it, had it continued to work., I actually bought 2. I'm changing my original 4 stars to just 2. The quality of the videos I shot and downloaded are very poor. Not the quality of my work! But from the camera. From both cameras. When I first noticed I went and shot with the other camera. Same thing! It's very disappointing., You get what you pay for.... video is extremely jumpy. Picture doesn’t even seem to be 720p., If you want to record your bike rides, this camera is NOT a good choice. It doesn’t have any image stabilization., Image is not clear, not 4K, This camera is easy to use and takes really good clear pictures. I've used this during hunts and for other random things. Great camera., Before I could use it for the third time. The clip that holds the buttons in place. The one for the power. Came off!! No it's useless under water or in salt air conditions!! Not happy at all!!! It was a week old at best!!, A little shakey when running but overall it's a nice camera for the price, Great videos, but the battery life is goes quickly., The battery didn't last very long - a couple hours at most.  The plus side is the camera comes with two rechargeable batteries so I was able to replace it when it died.  Video quality was good, picture quality left much to be desired.  I could've taken better pictures on my phone.  Sound is almost non-existent when in the water proof case.  It comes with many accessories that I couldn't figure out and the manual was no help.  Tons of accessories but not one selfie stick which is really what we wanted.  I bought this for a trip to Kauai and it served its purpose.  If you're looking for an affordable option for a vacation I recommend buying this camera.  If you're looking to get more usage than one trip, I'd recommend investing in a better camera., Great Color. But battery only lasts about 30 minutes., Quality seems very solid, has gone on a few kayaking trips so far and the waterproofing is up to the job.  Video quality is really good although I'll admit I haven't spent any time testing its limits as far as fast action or low light conditions.  I'll probably buy a few more, I have a Gen 1 Gopro Hero and this easily meets the same quality plus more features., Just check the video for yourself! This is a recording of the Audio/Video Sync Test available on YouTube that I recorded just minutes ago. I have emailed Akaso support. I'll provide an update once I hear back., The charging port no longer works, seems the fins in the actual port bent over?, Great value on the dollar., Got this for a trip to the USVI and got some great moments with it, This does not include a needed micro card., I purchased this item thinking it would be a bargain deal that's comparable to GoPro. They're incomparable and I wished I would've spent a little extra for a much better quality GoPro., Like how portable it is yet provides great quality videos, Great for the price. However, it only takes good video and pictures in high light. Low light settings look terrible. Definitely not 1080 p., Video quality is very poor. Cannot be use for anything proper. Phone take a better video, Just bought this for my daughter’s birthday. She will be using this on our vacation this summer!, I bought this camera as a good alternative to the name brand rival that is 5 times the cost, figured what do I have to lose, it’s only $75. I was actually pleasantly suprised that the video quality above and under water is really good. Then I downloaded the software from the app store and was wondering why it has so many bad reviews and barely a 2 star rating. After installing it I attempted to transfer some of my videos from the camera to my phone and the app would crash on any video that is longer then 1 minute in length. Also the downloaded videos remain with in the app and can’t be saved to your stream. In conclusion the iphone app is very poor quality and if you don’t mind removing the SD card to copy the video to your computer then this camera is a good buy, otherwise if you want to use the app on your phone and to transfer the video footage to your phone over wifi I would not recommend this camera or this brand, Image quality and stabilization is bad. Returning the product., Doesn't work properly as expected some time it turns on some time it doesn't battery were fully charge this item sucks, Really easy set up, Works Great!, I used it in my car to capture the back roads and the battery life is a lot shorter than another action camera.  Used it once ride and returned it just because of battery life., Nice action cam but they could do better no stabilization at all, No instructions included but did come with a good bit of attachments, It’s okay... I bought a memory card. When I video the screen blacks out after a min. There were bubbles on the screen when I opened it., I liked the camera and had good picture., Unfortunately the cover of my battery broke and now I can’t used, I wish they would include in the description somewhere that this camera does NOT include audio! Only photo/video. Waste of money for me.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The laptop arrived just in time for school!! Works great., Product description very much lied about the keyboard being backlit. Pretty pissed about that considering it the reason I chose this laptop over others I was looking at. Otherwise, it works fine for the basic little wprd processor I use it for. Also, not a cool design like any online description of the model. This one is straight flat black. Incredibly plain-looking. And one of my keys is at a wonky angle, but it works. Considering the ither asus products I own, this one falls short, honestly.If you want to take it out of S Mode, go to activation and choose to change your edition to regular Windows Home. Its a free switch., Works good.But the keyboard is not backlit.Good buy, if you don't need a backlit keyboard., I love how light weight and compact it is. And the numeric pad as well. So far I’m pretty happy and content with it., I ordered this small laptop for work purposes and general office operations.  So far, it's been well worth the money.  I took it out of Windows S mode.  It struggled (lagged) a bit with Chrome, so I resorted to using the Microsoft Internet browser but it's been fine.  And since I only use it for work (general office stuff), it's done everything that I could have asked....thus far!, The number dial is pretty accurate. Sleek design and very lightweight. Perfect product for the average commuter, If you feel that you need the trifling advantage of the \"easy access\" NumberPad, go ahead and buy this one. If you don't, avoid this one--it's a constant annoyance. Think you can permanently disable the NumberPad? Good luck with that., Amazing product it’s small do you can easily carry it around with no extra weight, For 190 bucks, this is perfect. I think tablets are very overrated.  I only like touchscreens on a phone.  This computer is the size of a tablet, incredibly light.  I just wanted something to do my financial stuff, email, shop and casually browse the internet.  I don't watch movies on my computer but it plays you tube type videos just fine.  sound is a little weak but if I want to listen to music I can cast it to my stereo.  What I like best is the size and weight. Small and light. And it seems to be built solid. I charge it at night and use it off and on all day and there is plenty of juice left. I could probably charge it every other night if I wanted.  I've only had it a couple weeks but I feel very good about my purchase., Screen was good but touch screen sucked...the lol mouse would disappear from screen and just pop up anywhere and wouldnt click on items the 1st click(it takes multiple clicks to get to where I'm trying to go)., It is perfect for my personal use and easy to navigate. Light weight and fits into my bag to carry with me., I like the size and for the price it’s worth buying., small, compact and convenient, Stay away from Windows 10 S ! Let me tell you what it is ..... trash 🗑!!!!!!! You can’t download anything from browser unless is from their crappy App Store! I couldn’t download Sketchup ! This is the worst part you CANT use GOOGLE!!! Like what the F ! They only allow you to use Bing ,who in the right mind uses that search engine!! No oneeee! You have to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to Windows 10 pro to be able to use your brand new computer like a normal person would like to do! Very very disappointed with this stupid “windows 10s” upgrade! (Not even an upgrade)!!!!! Please do your self a favor and buy a Mac !, My wife bought this for email and Facebook essentially. I had to uninstall the Windows 10S features because it kept freezing on the screen that said only approved windows 10 S apps would work.This warning came up randomly even though the only apps on the laptop WERE from the Microsoft App store.Finally I said ok no more Windows 10S and dropped it in favor of plain Windows 10. Since that time there has been no problem and no discernible detriment to the function. It is very small so be advised if this is a concern., ********************************** 07/24/2021 **********************************being firmilier with windows seizing possession of computers overclocking chip-sets and burning them out first on my listidisabled secure boot and set the supervisor password in bios so windows andits automatic this and automatic that could not inflict further damage to thehardware without firstly obtaining my express permissionnot trusting windows and its most advanced network hacking teqnikesi then proceeded to install my 9 GB linux clone in 10 minutes flathowever i needed windows to register this new computer sos i started windowsafter setup finished without a internet connection it said theres nointernet conection try this troubleshooterwhich arived at the decision that i needed to reset the router (NOT TRUE)  duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhbut why win 10 was updating at chip sizlun full throttle thats the true reason  out of pure curiosity i let this rogue os update it took a full day and a halfbefore i could use edge browser to register in my asusand by the way my last laptop used to do the same thing everytime itupdated until i**************************************************************** disabled the automatic updates  ** by setting the ipv4 gateway address to a bad address ** and unchecking ipv6 protocal  ** in the network configuration dialogue  ****************************************************************2 words braught the micysoft madness to a sqeeky halt********  GRUB-INSTALL *********the wifi chip is a realtekRTL8821CE---the cpu temp is a cool 100 degree farenhite after waking from a nap---and under your control linux will run your chipset at 108 degrees farenheightat idle with bluetooth radio on---in linuxvbox windows 98 running the yamaha SYXG50 soft synthysizer which by the wayrenders the dsp effects in software on 12 miditracks laden with yamaha sysex register 20% cpu utilizationand 117 degree farenheit cpu temp and play hifi music without hickupthis vm cuts the battery life to about 9 hours---also the battery has about 19 hours of secure browsing in it using 2048 bitencryption over bluetooth connect---intense usage such as simultaniuos remote desktop and ssl secure browsing bringtemp to even 120 degree and battery life is 1 hour per 10 percent battery capacity---running linux headless and radio off give you > 40 hours of batteryapache2 server + file sharing + encrypted ssh is on---in linuxthe 14 inch keyboard is backlighted up for your pleasure and for due reasonit is almost impossible to see your key in anything but direct sunlighthowever this is a much needed feature regaurdless  A very usefull feature on the extended keyboard is the well placed home and end keyit follows the standard template for laptops except there is one more row on the far rightwhich has the following keyspower buttonhomepage uppage downendFN*******************************************************************************linux xcfe desktop uses about 1.1 gig of memory out of the installed 4 Gigwith 6 virtual desktops and 5 different apps running*******************************************************************************the charging cord is 6 foot loong and she charges up from 50% to 99% in > a hour*******************************************************************************the integrated video tops out at 1920x1080 and bottoms out at 320x180and refresh rates vary from 60 hz to 120 hzthe battery life sinks exponentialy with increased resolution and refresh rates, I just wanted something simple to use for files and meetings. However, the webcam is awful. The image is poor quality and if you move at all you will be one big blur, so I will need to buy a separate webcam to use. The key clicks are loud as you type, and although the number pad on the mouse pad is a nifty option, it will come on and off when you don't intend it to. Overall, not bad for the price, but the high rating seems to be misleading. Not sure how much I trust Amazon reviews at this point, I saw no mention of the poor quality webcam and that was one thing I noticed right off the bat considering how prevalent Zoom is nowadays., Worked great out of the box but would not turn on the next day.  Shame as it was perfect for my needs., Quit working after a week, It has M.2 which supports NVMe SSD.soldered RAM, works pretty fine to me. I buy it for my daughter and it have all thing that she needs., Perhaps I goofed or something, but even a live boot wouldn't take., It is not user friendly., Well worth the price. Small long battery life. Enough capability to support remote learning, Cheap Chinese garbage, So far the L210 slim laptop is good for working on projects and would make a great investment for a highschool or college grade laptop. Had to make a couple adjustments like uninstall the graphics driver and install the intel one because graphics problems with chrome as well as in chrome disable the \"use hardware acceleration when available\" setting because of graphics errors caused. the other adjustment made was creating my own power plan because with the one that comes pre-made for it doesnt do the laptop much justice. basic power plan was 4-6 hours on battery but with a well setup plan have it setup it can do 6-10 hours with videos and 10-12 hours on everything else from browsing web to having multiple programs running. some stuff you should know is the graphics is 2gb which can handle 1080 videos easy depending on your internet speed. 4gb of ram and barely any is actually used unless you have alot of programs running at once. the processor says 1.2ghz dual core but the speeds that have been running are  1.8-4ghz so far depending on whats running. doesnt get too hot when running games or videos so wont get burns when sitting a your lap. 1 thing tho is that it is listed as having a backlit keyboard but it does not have one. After dealing with windows updates and driver updates theres around 20-25 gb left of space available so if you decide to buy one of these laptops make sure to get a micro sd card for it so you can expand the space and i recommend 120-500 gig., Works good, fast, light weight., Outside of the mouse pad \" I like it a lot.\", It's been more than a month since I got mine and about 3 weeks in the touch pad stopped working. Trying getting it fixed by a technician who wants an arm and a leg to fix it. I'm not a fan of using a mouse so disappointment is an understatement at this stage., Remember you get what you pay for. Very slow but for paying bills and very light gaming it is serviceable., Initially I thought I'd gotten one of those rare deals ... something fairly good for a lower price.  I was being optimistic.1.  Screen saver doesn't work2.  When in \"sleep\", you can't always get the computer to wake up - you have to reboot3.  Applications lock randomly - Chrome, Excel etc - initially thought it happened after the laptop had been idle for awhile - but it happens randomly at any time, even when in use.  Some or all app's become locked/unresponsive and you have to close/restart them4. This is more a personal gripe - the sound quality is very poor.  But again, it's a low end computer so it really should be expected - I just didn't expect the sound to be this bad.On the plus side -1.  It is fairly fast and boots quickly, The picture description says BACK-LIT KEYBOARD, but it isn't! Whomever designed the website for ASUS should be fired! I went through a big hassle trying to find an ASUS laptop that actually had the back-lit keyboard that was advertised on several of their models, but didn't have it! I wound up buying an ASUS 14\" laptop that actually had the ADVERTISED back-lit keyboard from Office Depot/Office Max. I had them verify it before I bought it., USPS delivered this today. Big box with a fairly big box (and padding) in it with a small and light laptop in that. I had it unpacked and charging in no time.Since I never intended to ever use the WIN10 installed on it (or even boot it) it took a bit to figure out how to get into the computer settings so that I could boot from a USB drive that I had Linux Mint installer loaded on.A WORD OF CAUTION for those that are going to install Linux - the current popular install .ISO's don't have the drivers for the WIFI chip! The drivers will have to be installed manually. Bluetooth does however work and I was easily able to link this computer to my iPhone and get out to the internet that way.WORK A ROUND: I ordered a cheap (~$20) \"TP Link\" USB 802.11N (only 2.5Ghz) Wifi adapter, plugged it in and it just works. Maybe someday Linux will have drivers for the built in WiFi chip in this device.While the only CPU'S that Intel makes that are crapper than a Celeron is a Atom I found this on the web:\"The Intel Celeron N4020 is one of the most budget-friendly and power-efficient laptop processors. ... As for gaming, the Intel UHD 600 graphics of the Celeron N4020 is one of the weakest solutions. It can be used only for the lightest games.\"To sum up the above, it is a very cheap and uses very little power.For its size, the keyboard and screen are ok. The keys have good travel. It has a matte screen.This is a small and very light computer. It is 'snappy' enough surfing the web and running Linux native applications. While I'm not clear on this but it appears that it can be charged with a standard USB-C charger.I'll have to take it out in the wild to see how the battery life holds up on it. Running Linux the battery should last as least as long (or longer!) than it does while running WIN10., I bought this laptop to use for leisure travel this next year.  Wanted something bigger and more useful than the tablet I currently have.  While I have just started the setup process, ie loading my apps, files, etc., it is doing exactly what I wanted it to do.  I've switched to Windows Home, installed all my apps and it's currently updating Windows.  It is showing lots of promise!, This was a MAJOR selling feature for me since I work nights. Description needs updated., It's fine otherwise, but the trac pad stopped working a few days after we started using it., Recieved yesterday.Still reading info on using micro soft...... I'm use to Google use but this lap top has much more to offer IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET USE TO IT.., Purchased this laptop in March 2021 and it only lasted six months with light use. One day I could no longer connect to the internet. Ran the troubleshooter and it said it could not find a network adapter. Tried everything suggested, but still can't connect to the internet. Total waste of money!, I am giving this tablet two stars as it is inexpensive (under $200) and lightweight, other than that I would give it one star.  I should have read the description more carefully as it is not a touchscreen model.  Get your fingers to work on the touchpad if hard enough but the way this was designed if you aren't very careful you are constantly turning on the numbering feature.  It is a serious stupid design.  You have all the number above the alpha keys. Grab a calculator if you need it.  I waited too long on return it., Excellent for just information support for your job, 365 micro soft is useless, For the price you can’t complain it works for basic usage as browsing the Internet. I would recommend for anyone who needs a laptop with basic functionality ., Easy to use, up in a second.  I love it.  Then I realized that I couldn't hear a damn thing.  I'm on a computer 12 hours a day, I know how to work them.  I adjusted the controls...blah blah.  Could barely hear the volume on some things, particularly YOUTUBE.  Finally looked and lo and behold, the speaker are on the bottom. How in the hell can speakers project when you have the danged thing in your lap?  My thighs completely block all sound.  So in order to hear certain things, I have to hold it up to my face.  Yes, I've trouble shooted everything. Yes, I know what I'm doing, and Yes, I'm sending it back.  SOUND SUCKS and I don't want to have a little speaker attached to the top so I can hear., Perfect for what it has been designed for: internet browsing, music, playing videos. can play Terraria, Arrived without windows bootingUpon boot enter BIOS and I get “no bootable device”. You can tell the manual has been beat up. When filling in return on Amazon I find support phone number but despite being advertised as open nobody answers., I dislike the confusion with it's programs. Not one to be a \"refresher\" on..after so many years!I feel I made a mistake with choosing this.., Laptop is smaller but has everything you need for school and very light so easy to travel with overall good computer for price, Sound stopped working completely after a week, It won't turn on after having it led than 30 days, What I expected, It’s cute, and quiet, but the screen is made in a way that you HAVE to look at it at a certain angle or it feels weird on your eyes and only the center circle is bright while the edges appear dark.  I’ve never hated a laptop screen so much. It’s almost like it has a privacy screen on it., Well it really wasn't what I was looking for. It's kinda slow, and I really couldn't get too many good apps on it. And it seems much smaller than what it's size is supposed to be., I wanted this laptop to do only one thing - act as the control for a label printer, but it couldn't even do that. It took forever to boot, and everyday tasks kept crashing it. Totally useless! I returned it as soon as I could get it to shutdown., This computer was a great purchase for my son. He likes to play Roblox, Minecraft and Steam games. This computer has the capability and speed to play these games and plenty of room to hold them. It is not a gaming computer but is capable of playing these games without too much lag time. The touchpad that moves the mouse icon does like to stop responding to touch but simply press the F6 key to toggle it back on and off and it will start working or plug in a mouse. The battery lasts an extremely long amount of time. The display is very clear and good quality. Excellent product for the price. The seller, Lucky Trading, has excellent customer service and was very helpful with communication and when I needed product support. Highly recommended., I only needed the computer for zoom.  Whenever I touched the mic I had to hit it several times to turn on mic to speak.  It was a pain so I returned the computer.  I prefer touch screen & a larger screen., It took about ten minutes to download Google Chrome, and when it did, simply opening a new tab on the app took at least two minutes for it to fully load. I bought this laptop to use for writing and schoolwork, but the speed was just unbearable., Much smaller than I imagine but was ok. Easy to carry around, fast enough for my use., Dislike nothing! I use it for work  l like that it was easy to use, It's a laptop and it does laptop things. If you need it to do heavy intensive things, it might not do the things.But if you keep your expectations low, you'll probably not be disappointed., The size and range of motion is pretty coolEdit: the family safety automatically being turned on is irritating. The dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. I’ve taken some mins to set the computer up I don’t want to spend more time, Screen might put some people off. Battery is phenomenal, it’s silent, and the audio is fine. Perfect for on the go.  \n",
       "4  Bought for school work. Doing good so far.Sleek., It's alright, I bought this laptop a week ago. The touch pad worked at first. Once, I upgraded Windows 10. The touch pad stopped working. I went to the Acer site, to download a new driver for this pos. Of course it didn't work. That's why I'm giving this a bad review! I've tried several things to fix this laptop. None of them worked!, My son loves his laptop, One of his favorite devices so far.. One suggestion by memory card to go along with this laptop, I purchased this for my online college classes and am so glad I did. Awesome product!, This computer has totally inadequate volume.  The return was readily accepted by the seller but when I actually took the computer into the UPS store, I had to pay $21 to have it shipped WITH the properly printed return label !  Never had to pay to return an Amazon purchase before!!!!  What a ripoff!!!, Best laptop for this price, 5 star, I love everything about this laptop!, Horribly horrible computer! Do not buy! Screen went out in less than a week! Only used it once or twice before it went to H E double hockey sticks to, The trackpad has scrapes in it when I got it. Returned it, it's been two weeks and I'm being told it will take another 2 weeks for my refund to process. The body is also thin plastic and not metal like some other aspire 7s, including the trackpad. Get another gaming laptop, the ROG zephyrus g14 is on sale at best buy right now for almost the same price with a better GPU & CPU and an all aluminum chassis., Basically the one thing that turned me off is that it warns you not to download the Google browser because it may make it unstable., This will be my last Acer. I expect notebooks to last around  3 years and that is when you actually use it. I used this one as a spare and hardly used it at all. In fact I just found it does not even have a battery that you can take out. I would not recommend this product., GREAT little laptop. Performs well. I do mostly work on it (Microsoft Office, Audio editing on Audacity, minor video editing and some music composition with Sibelius) and it runs flawlessly. Occasionally I travel and play games on it (league of Legends and World of Warcraft) and it runs those just fine too (WoW on lower graphics settings). only down side to this machine is there's VERY little memory. Make absolutely sure you budget for cloud storage, or an external hard drive if you go with this machine., Not nearly enough RAM, slows up with just basic web browsing, This is a great laptop for the price, but the worst thing about it is the placement of the touchpad, it's on the left hand side below the keyboard, which makes no sense.  It should be centered or more on the right.The screen color is also a bit bright, so if you want to edit photos on here beware of that.  Also this thing is kinda heavy., This is not bad, but I would not buy it again. The speakers are horrible and under the computer. making it hard to hear (I am deaf) and you have to pick up the computer to hear them. The cap lock key does not a light on it let you know it is on. Drives me crazy. No CD Rom either.  :(, Love this laptop except why would you put the speakers on the bottom which makes the sound horrible?  At least make the max volume higher so you can at least hear without needing external speakers!, Initially, once I set everything up, I was pretty pleased with my purchase! But after a little over a month (and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month), the screen went black but the back-light on the keyboard was still on. So, I figured it just needed to be charged. I left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it. Still, lit keys but no screen. So I changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more. Came back to it, same thing. I tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference. I never took it out of \"S\" mode, and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs. Basically, just checked my email a few times. Now when I plug it in, nothing lights up. The adapter on the charger doesn't have any indicator light to show that it's working, so it could be a faulty power cord.I'm going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers. But in any case, a brand new device should last longer than a month.Now my return window has closed so I'm either stuck with a $350 paperweight, or I'll have to search online and buy a new charger and hope that works..., I do not spend a lot of time on the computer. I purchased the computer so I could do some personal writing. I like the fact that it had Microsoft Office installed. I did not like the the restriction to only use apps provided through the Microsoft store.  To download other apps, like zoom, I had to disable the Microsoft security system, which cannot now be reactivated on my machine.  But as far as general use of the computer, it has been great., Unfortunately, I have to write a bad review on this one. I have babied this laptop and while it was a decent for cheap laptop, I can't believe it just died on me after 14 months. I didn't get a warranty because the price was more than half of the laptop cost...again, inexpensive laptop. I expect slow, etc. but not death., Easy to set up, liked the keyboard. I added another 4 GB memory.  Just a nice overall laptop., It is a lot smaller screen, keyboard, etc., than I had before.  Though I had an Acer Aspire before.  I don't like it, probably will return it, and wouldn't recomment it for older people., Nice laptop for the money. I still don't like Windows. Battery life is lousy, My lab top has quit working. It will not restart it is froze & my mouse will not work it won’t let me do anything, For the price point its a great laptop. First I added another 2GB RAM for under $20 and upgraded. Before I start with the positive one big negative. When the laptop goes to sleep mode, it take 25-40 sec before it wakes up. It's very strange. Its not a traditional hard drive. I didnt change any settings. I have to hit the power button and literally sit there for it to turn on. Pretty annoying. Other than that screen quality is phenomenal. Speed is more than adequate for MS office apps . It can also handle streaming and 8-10 browsers at a time.  For school, work , anything non hardcore this is a good laptop. Sound quality I aways use my bluetooth headset anyway. Sound is bit more towards the stereo sound. I am sure that can be adjusted, just havn't played with it.Like others have said, you cannot go wrong at this price point. I just hope it lasts and dont bog down or slow down with updates and what not...., this laptop is giving me nightmares. the touchpad is super sensitive to \"accidentally\" turning off. ok, fine. restart and it's back to normal if nothing else works (forgetting the inconvenience). then this morning after an update to windows 10, the touchpad isn't simply off. it isn't in settings, there are no drivers, it's just effing gone. so here i am, using a mouse i hate, because the laptop basically doesn't work as a laptop. take into consideration when thinking about purchasing this model. it's cheap, yes, but if you actually need to use on the go or in your lap, it's a bad choice., I purchased this laptop for general purposes as well as using the Cricut Desgin Space for my Cricut machine. My old laptop was just running too slowly and I needed an upgrade. First off, the price is amazing, and I'm fully aware that you get what you paid for but I feel like I got MORE than I paid for with this. I don't know much about specs and the ins and outs of computers so here are some pros and cons from a general user:PROS:- The look and design is very very sleek- Fairly lightweight- The screen resolution - AMAZING!- It seems fast so far- The battery life is very good. I've been working continuously for about three hours now without it plugged in and I still have 1/4 battery life left.- It does come downloaded with Windows 10 S Mode however there's literally a sticker directly on the box directing you to a website that explains a STUPIDLY EASY four step process to permanently get out of S mode. It was the first thing I did (based on other reviews) and have no issues. IT WAS FREE TO DO AND TOOK 2 MINUTES!!CONS:- Caps Lock/Num Lock do not have an indicator light. I'm already finding this very annoying but I use a USB keyboard most of the time anyway so it's fine.- The sound is awful. If you're using this laptop for streaming, games, etc. you will need headphones. No seriously... it's really bad. The quality is okay but it does not get loud AT ALL.Overall with a couple of days of use I'm impressed with this!!! Purchase ASAP if you're looking for an affordable general use laptop :), I bought this laptop for my wife for her job. I wanted something not pricey and just something that worked. I saw the high amount of five star reviews and I read through some of the lower starred reviews and thought, that won't happen to me, BS!!First of all, the computer got shipped quickly and got here undamaged but that is the only good I can say about it. The backlight for the keyboard goes off quickly and you have to press a key to turn it back on instead of moving the mouse and you cannot change it. As you may have read in other reviews, the computer comes with Windows 10 S Mode installed but my product key is not genuine. It says that the digital license is not valid. Because of this it WILL NOT ACTIVATE WINDOWS. Which means I CANNOT TAKE IT OUT OF S MODE. If the computer is in S Mode then you cannot download any apps or programs that you would normally use like Mozilla or VLC or even Chrome. And furthermore, you cannot access the Command Prompt which means you cannot even activate the Windows even if you wanted to.I have contacted Microsoft who told me that they could not do anything and to contact ACER. I contacted ACER and they told me to try one single thing, which I already did and confirmed that it does not work, then told me I had to send in the laptop to the techs which would take another two weeks just to get it back.Sooooooooooooooooo, long story short, it is a never ending loop of disappointment, anger and resentment and a complete waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE., This laptop was overpriced., Screen quality is decentTouch screen not reallyThis isn’t a gaming laptopTurn off the wifi so it doesnt interfere with your cell phones connectivity or other tablet/computer., Overall, a great laptop for the price. I added 8G of RAM really easily. It is fast and cheap. However, some technical issues:- S mode is horrible. Got rid of it immediately.- My powerpoint screen recording function would not work. Called Microsoft and they were very helpful. They rolled back my display driver to Microsoft Basic and worked perfectly, but then the computer would not recognize my second screen. Called Acer, and they told me they didn't have another display driver to download and referred me to a third party (Answers By) that wanted to charge me $99 to fix the issue...- For some reason, the internet was really slow. Played with two different routers I had. It was still slow even with a tri-band router and no other devices connected to the internet. Then, I connected to the guest wifi I had set up and it worked perfectly. I suspect this may be a driver/software issue.For the price, it is hard to beat this, but get ready for some compatibility issues and no support from ACER..., THIS PC WAS GOOD BUT THE CAMERA DID NOT WORK I OPENED CASE THEY COULD NOT FIS IT  POOR PRODUCT SUPPORT DOD NOT BUY THIS PC  DO NOT BUY THIS PC. VERY POOR SUPPORT FROM AMAZON AND ACER, Product wouldn’t work out of the box, and after an hour with tech support made the decision to return., I love everything about this laptop. Especially the built in Alexa. It's so sleek and stylish. My daughter told me it looked just like her MAC laptop. Best buy anywhere for a laptop at a reasonable price with all the features!, Arrived late, Speaker volume is low.great LT for price! Won’t find anywhere else., Stopped working after 4 months of light use., The first time I attempted to use my webcam for a important Zoom interview, it would not work. After Acer did hours of trouble shooting, with no resolve, they told me I had no other choice but to reset my laptop to factory settings, which meant I lost almost everything I had on my laptop. When it was determined that losing all of my content was for nothing, they finally checked the device manager and discovered that no Webcam drivers had been installed! They then told me that I would have to pay to send the laptop back to them for repairs! I refused to pay out anything more. Needless to say I Will Never purchase from Acer again.!, Hard Drive crashed after 7 months and it was going to cost more than the computer to fix., Product arrived on time and was as advertised.  No surprises., Nothing special about this. Recent buy, no issues thus far. Appreciate the graphics card vs the \"newer model\" with the integrated card. Helps with some lighter games and other graphics-intensive apps., Horrible product. Bought it in March and it keeps disconnecting from the internet, sound is absolutely horrible. Now I have a laptop that is absolutely useless., It will not stay connected to WiFi - I constantly have to reconnect to wifi even after just a few minutes of inactivity., Everything is good for the price but  the volume  is to low... l had to return and get an apple instead. Even though it is double the price., This is a nice laptop for the price.  No issues so far at all.  I did need to take it out of S mode in order to install Zoom which is basically mandatory these days., The batter life is trash, and heats up fast, I bought this entry level Acer as an extra to have around and wasn't expecting much for the price.  Everything about this computer is very good EXCEPT for the low volume of the sound.  I'm not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume. I wasn't expecting BOSE quality, but I was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100%; it isn't.  Here's what I did, checked drivers, opened the Realtek to confirm all were set at 100%.  Upon researching other reviews, I noticed similar low volume issues; it appears that this is where Acer skimped. (I have an entry level Toshiba that has horrible quality sound, but it is loud.) I need to Blu-tooth an external speaker just so I don't have to bring my ears to w/in 8\" just to hear.  Of course, it doesn't help that Acer put the speakers on the bottom, yes, the bottom of the unit. It's a shame that Acer did so much right for the price, only to mess up on a incredibly low volume!  Would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100%?  The answer to my rhetorical question is no, but they did anyway.Overall, I would have given the unit 4 stars, maybe even 5, but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3, at best, unfortunately.My take-away is that I won't buy another Acer without hearing the sound first., built in camera and mic not working, Computer works well. Still trying to learn the operating system as it is different from the last computer., Worked fine for 13 months of occasional use, and then out of nowhere, the motherboard failed--just outside of the mfr warranty window. Piece of junk!, I absolutely love this laptop, key board lights went out and i am a senior citizen with eye problems who runs a help line to get services for families trying to get moms into recovery and am limited in times i can help to day times when i can see the keys, Microsoft edge is the worst browser first off, secondly this laptop did an automatic update and deleted several of my saved documents which are unrecoverable- hours of work are lost. It also blanked out 4x during a timed midterm exam last week.I have had this laptop for just 6 months - sad to say, I won’t purchase Acer again., I purchased this product based on many reviews .  After waiting 30 minutes to set up this thing, I called Acer support.  This thing would not set up Windows.  There is a 22 digit serial number that has to be provided fast and you have to use a telescope since the type is very small and is located no where near where the tech said it was.  Am going on 3 hours now to fully set thing up and am about ready to send it back.  Pure frustration.  This thing has all kinds of features but one important feature it lacks is the ability to set it up without having to take 3 hours of your life to do so.  Recommend you buy something else., overall its an ok computer , but the speakers seems damaged, its extremely low and theres a feedback, Computer works great, just as advertised, good value, would buy again, Works exactly how I expected it to and does everything I need it to do. A very good laptop for the price given., I got this for gaming by day 3 the touch pad stopped working. I troubleshooted it for days. Nothing worked. It only works with a mouse. I was very disappointed. I returned this item and will buy a different brand. Really sucks cause I liked it for gaming☹️, I have been very satisfied with this purchase so far.  I've only had it set up for less than a week, so I can't really state how well the battery is going to be,,,but so far it is great.  I have only had one small problem with setting up the email, but I'm just going on my web browser and accessing it from there, not sure what the problem is, probably something on my \"non-thechie\" side of the screen.  It is a great value for the money and I have absolutely no complaints.  The best feature I have found so far is the back lit keyboard....I had no idea how wonderful this would be....it's great.  I used to have to squint or turn on a light, but not anymore.  It's really an amazing little labptop and the screen is crystal clear.  The speed is very fast and so far I am loving this laptop way more than the last 2 Hewlett Packards that I have had to replace due to faulty battery setting.  I love this computer., Works like a charm, Keyboard start to having pressing issue after a while. Specially the one you use most. Otherwise it’s a great computer, I bought this computer for a new full time remote position. The computer is great for VERY BASIC NEEDS. Only a couple tabs open and browsing the internet. I needed to have 10+ tabs open and be able to toggle back and forth very quickly for my role and this computer could unfortunately not keep up. If you need something faster, I would get the same computer but with an i5 processor for $200 more. Well worth the difference. Have had the new computer for a week and it runs remarkable faster and can keep up with what I need done.Also, I plugged in a bluetooth mouse to this computer, and once I unplugged it, I could not get the touch pad to work anymore, so it is a good thing I am returning it as it also had this alternative issue., backlit keyboard is nice, but I hate to have to pay for word processing.  I hate this \"Gortana\" which pops up all the time., it is a cheaper computer that does its job.But the mouse pad thing doesn't work anymore. so I have to use a external mouse, This has the potential to be a good computer, but Acer ships this in S mode. Windows 10 Home cannot be activated. Running SLUI 4 will open the installation ID, but Microsoft cannot activate that number.  The agent said I needed to call Acer.  I called the toll-free number included with the computer and was told by that agent to call Microsoft (whodathunk?) or send it to Acer to be \"repaired.\"  It was out of the box for ten minutes and they wanted it to be repaired! Thanks to Amazon-- it is being returned.  Run  Away., I purchased this computer for my small business job. Within two weeks of use, the down key came off. Amazon's response is to glue the key down, which is ABSURD. You can't just glue a key down, which I explained, but they said that is all that they could do. They would not replace the computer., I purchased this laptop for school / social media / youtube / browsing & i absolutley love it. No complaints so far., It’s really good I actually got it two days earlier than they said they were going to send it to me which that is great, Not lasting more then 1hr! And lagging when you unplug the cable., Still working on this. Hope to up my rating if we can get things working. First experience with the system was very positive. Issue is that on day two I saw a message in the lower right corner of the screen: \"Go to settings to Activate Windows\". Settings says \"We can't activate Windows on this device because you don't have a valid digital license or product key. If you think you have a valid license or key, select Troubleshoot below. Troubleshooter says \"Something interrupted our troubleshooting.\" Called Acer support and was told they would mail me Windows Installation USB memory stick. Waited a little over one week and asked for status update. Was told that USB install media was not available, and I should contact Microsoft for activation. Entered last four digits from activation error message and was told I would need a new product key. Contacted Acer support again, and was told we would need to return the computer to the factory for fix; which could take 15-20 business days, plus shipping time. Briefly considered returning to Amazon, be decided to try the Acer service option. Will be awhile before we get it back., The physical device is very nice.  Lighted keyboard good EXCEPT no indicators for Caps Lock nor Num Lock.  That is unfortunate (what, Acer saved $2 to not include two little leds). Bluetooth non-operating out of the box so will need to troubleshoot.  Touchpad stopped functioning after a few weeks - another thing to troubleshoot...  Hope that is all the bad stuff that happens to this new machine., We got this as a grad. gift for our grandson. Great price, great laptop & fast delivery!!, Flimsy.  Returned it., Finally unboxed this laptop.. have not used much but the charger that came with it is not original making me think it's a refurbished laptop advertised as 'new' or sent a used one.. will update this review when I've used it a bit..if I don't return it..., It very light weight but not very fast. Screen quality it’s good., Purchased this for a high school kid. Does what it needs to do. The base model is ok. I like that you can upgrade this in the future. They included the bracket for a secondary drive. I will be buying more of these for clients, Works well for school Wish I had read I to description more No sd card or disc reader So cost wasn’t as well as I thought after buying external  readers, Windows does not run as smoothly on the Acer as it did on my Dell. My games do not work as well. Have to refresh page often when searching on internet. Not happy with this product., Can’t complain about an Acer product for the price and quality!, I live everything about it except the battery lifeI constantly has to recharge it to appoint i just kept it plugged most of the time, A good performance., To summarize, you get what you pay for. I was not expecting to run into so many problems right when I took this out of the box.1. Immediately I heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when I pulled it out of its packaging.2. The sound is so bad it's like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store. The speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality.3. Loud fan when it gets a little warm when using.4. Scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs. I had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos I noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs.5. Customer service from both Acer and Amazon makes it difficult to fix your/my issues. I contacted customer service the same day after I received this laptop and also the day after. After telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to Acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed.6. Possible restocking fee. Wanting to return this item, even though I barely used it the first 2 days, customer service told me that I cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it BEFORE they can tell me whether or not I will be charged a restocking fee. If you don't like being surprised by restocking fees, don't buy this laptop so you won't have to return.7, I was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem (basically to spend more money just so I can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file.8. Screen quality is definitely not good. I would give it a 6/10. The color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor, the difference is super noticeable.9. 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me. You would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you're basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usable.I know this has good reviews but don't be fooled by it. I was swayed when I was going through the reviews but after I got my product, I was highly disappointed. I wish I had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop. This one is not worth the regular price. I would say with the issues and quality of this laptop, the price should be around $250., Works fine.  Sound could be louder., I tried 3 of them they perform differently from each other and they appeared to have different hardware suppliers internal parts made by random manufacturers for example M.2 port is only PCIE X2 speed  and advertised internal sata3 port performs about 300mb write and 500mb read on a drive rated 530mb write 550mb read.Over it looks as if it was put together in a hurry debris around plastic body can easily can cut hands skin etc., This laptop is great and I had it for months, but when I first got it I had to pay another 100 dollars to take s mode off of it., The computer itself is great for basic use (checking email, browsing the internet, writing papers, etc). I bought it because I have a MacBook and most Department of Defense websites aren’t compatible with Mac OS. My biggest complaint is that 1 month into owning it, the charging cable doesn’t seem to work anymore and I’m terrified for the day that the battery dies and I have no way of charging it after that., Not good as described. Not hapoy with battery performance., It's a great laptop sometimes it can act a bit uppity but just restart it if you just installed some apps. Also it comes on S mode which you can change to regular windows 10 for FREE!  Go in settings > application > Switch to windows 10 mode, Good laptop but ended returning, found one better., Cheap laptop.  You get what you pay for.  No hard drive.  No cd player.  Mouse board difficult to control., The product key on the laptop was bad and so I could not activate it. Acer customer support was horrible, told me if I had bought it directly from them they could have given me a new product key but since I bought it from Amazon I'm pretty much on my own. Last time I buy this brand., Machine is a really great budget machine. I got it for my wife for school but more than just a throw away machine. In the standard form, it was nothing great. Adding more RAM woke it up a lot. Better overall performance.The back-lit keyboard is huge plus for working at night. Screen resolution and clarity is great as well., I had to return my laptop after the mouse cursor had mysteriously quit working after 3 days of use. While I am used toto Apple products, I tried troubleshooting my Windows laptop, even tried restarting in Safe Mode to troubleshoot, without resolve. I even performed Windows Recovery. Still, no resolve. Confused, I thought, That’s okay, I am within the allotted time to return my laptop. So, I requested a Return and opted for a new replacement (vs. refund). I was careful to ensure I remained in compliance with the Return Policy as set out by Amazon and followed the instructions, step-by-step. I downloaded the RA# and UPS label provided and used it to return my laptop as instructed. The following day, I checked the Amazon website for status of my return, only to discover that all information about my return mysteriously disappeared! I didn’t think much of it as more than a temporary technical error, as it was admittedly nearing the deadline for return. Having carefully followed instructions per Amazon’s Return Policy and with my Proof of Shipment Receipt from UPS, I was confident it would work itself out. NOPE. Evidently not. More than two weeks later, NO REPLACEMENT, NO REFUND, NO RESPONSE. …NO COMMUNICATION. And, Four to Five text messages later to the Seller (via Amazon website) — along w/ submission of my proof of shipment receipt and tracking# — STILL NO RECORD OF iNITIATION OR TRACKING OF MY RETURN. The History of my messages to Amazon / Seller and my Return Request are also *POOF* GONE!What the $&@! NO PHONE NUMBERS; Just the runAround.Apparently, I am now out $500 — AND a laptop. …Fabulous.KNOW THE RISK!, This laptop is 14\"!!! I'm soooo angry!, This laptop is great, its affordable and have a bunch of cool features. The only issue is that it is extremely low. you definitely need a headset or speakers. I have to lift the device to my ears to hear if I dont have any of these available.  I have had it for a year and so far so good., I love it.  Easy to work with, screen is small. whole computer is really a tiny bit larger than a notebook, but the processor is fast and all.. I thought i was upgrading, but i have to wear glasses when using this thing to see the letters., I HAVE ORDERED FOUR ACER LAPTOPS FROM AMAZON IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND LOVE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE BUY A FIFTH ACER LAPTOP, AFTER READING ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS ONE. THEY WERE WRONG AND VERY MISLEADING. I SHOULD HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, THEY WERE ACCURATE. THIS ACER LAPTOP WAS THE WORST, SOUND SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE, YOU CAN BARELY HEAR IT EVEN IF YOU TURN IT UP TO THE MAX, THE MOUSE PAD AND KEYS WERE UNRESPONSIVE, CAN'T ADJUST THE SETTINGS, ETC. I USED IT FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY MINUTES,..... 30 MINUTES  AFTER I CHARGED IT AND I PUT IT RIGHT BACK  IN THE PACKAGING.  I COULD NOT GET IT OUT OF MY HOUSE FAST ENOUGH.  WITHIN AN HOUR, I CALLED AMAZON FOR RETURN AUTHORIZATION TO PICK UP THE LAPTOP THE FOLLOWING DAY.  I GOT MY FULL REFUND, AMAZON'S EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE SAVED THE DAY.  GREATLY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS ACER LAPTOP. BUYER BEWARE., Cons:-over heats-speakers are horrible can barely hear videos (had to install an additional app to make sound louder)-computer lags a bit (shouldn’t lag for the price of it)- not recommend for the pricePros:-Good quality when watching videos etc, I like everything about this computer EXCEPT THE VOLUME-YOU CAN BARELY HEAR ANYTHING ON IT!, dislike the teeny hddlike I can throw an external drive on it and am gtg after taking it OUT of s modenear perfect for my needs and decent price, Not touchscreen as was advertised in the question and answer section. The graphics are so so. Worse than my last Acer. Overall 4 stars., Good computer. I’m using it to create elearning.When I tried to remove the computer from Windows S mode, I realized that the computer did not come with a product key. What this means is in order to remove S mode, you have to buy Windows Home or Pro and use the product key to remove S mode. I wish they would have just told me that! I contacted the company via amazon chat, they said I needed to contact the manufacturer. They gave me a phone number. There is a button on amazon to contact the manufacturer as well. No success.I ended up just buying the downloadable Windows home version and used the product key to remove S mode. I also purchased the microsoft software for powerpoint, word, excel, etc.That's a lot of drama just to be able to download things to my computer. Just know that you are buying a bare bones computer when you purchase., Was a great computer until I had used it twice for Zoom and now the speakers no longer work.  If I figure out why I will update., When I first received this laptop everything seemed great, I was very excited to set it up with my personal information and get going-- I very quickly realized, however, that this computer was EXTREMELY slow for my tastes.  Even with no background programs, simple tasks like opening file explorer or a web browser took far too much time.  In my opinion, a brand new computer should be opening programs almost instantly, not leaving me waiting a few seconds or more.  This is ultimately preference, but I'm sure there are many more laptops out there for a similar price point that would run much faster.  Returned this after only a day or so of having it and ended up with another laptop from the early 2010's and it runs much better than this one., I had this laptop for about 2 months now and I'm loving it so far. It's lightweight, sleek, and the backlit keys are great for me in my dark room. It boots up in seconds ready to go when you turn it on. I mostly use this for watching videos and streams and excels it that. The only negative that I can think of is the placement of the speakers. The speakers are placed on the bottom and really muffle the sound so my volume is always at max. Other than that the laptop is a great budget buy., Displeased. Some black (looks more like green) dotted lines are running down the middle of my screen. Looks like some kind of defect. The laptop was purchased at the start of September and didnt see usage until about the 25th of September, which means In about two months this situation happened. Was satisfied with my purchase before this occurrence., I’m not sure if it has “touch screen”., Poor quality. Cheap, just like the price. Laptop is unlikely to last you long. Charging port was junk.On the positive side, it is very light and small.If you choose to purchase this laptop, best of luck to you., The battery died after a week and the screen started blinking. I needed to connect an external monitor to work. BAD BAD BAD., I was told I was going to get a new battery sent to me because every since I have the laptop it will only turn on if it is plugged in to the wall and i never received a new one.., very cheesy one , keep freezing ,not able open files or photos , not going waste my time to fight that, I love this laptop. The screen is a great size. It’s light weight not heavy and very sleek., Good laptop, I don't do anything out of the ordinary.  Does what a laptop is made to do.  I stayed with ACER because my previous laptop was ACER.  If it didn't lose the 'W' key function I'd still be using it, but would buy a new battery because unless it's plugged in it randomly shuts down, bad battery. So, the new laptop had a new surprise.  The sound volume is very poor.  Now lugging a wifi speaker along wherever the laptop goes.  I have to not recommend for this very reason., Absolute garbage, I really dont write reviews but when I do I usually make them for the people this laptop is good when it works but I only used this about 10 times and now it does not charge or turn on pretty much got robbed I'm really disappointed I was really hyped about this product but no durability whatsoever no scratch or anything looks brand new and it's a lemon buyers beware., Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop 15.6 inches Full HD computer stop working this month July 2021.  I purchase this item in October 2020 as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  Unfortunately, the computer has stop working and the battery will not charge.  Please contact me in reference to the warranty information.  I would not purchase another computer through AMAZON.  No customer service support when needed., bought this for my brother laid up with back surgery-easy to work great graphics and definitely user friendly!, All ok so far, cute unit--but does not work after two hours =  black screen & deadmay i have a replacement unit?, I love this computer, but the mouse pad doesn’t work. Had to buy a wireless mouse to even use it. But otherwise great product, Good quality, use it to work from home and meetings and classed., I faced several issues with this PC in spite on light usage. First google meet does not work on all browsers and suddenly mutes the conversation. We spent ages trying to solve this problem until we discovered that it works only on microsoft edge.Sound quality is not clear and low.Finally the battery stopped charging and the laptop does not work except when it is plugged in power. All of this happened after less than 8 months of usage.A total waste of money, The product arrived with a bad wireless card. I returned the item and the refund was applied to a Amazon gift card instead of my credit card. I am not happy., I’ve had this computer for a year and for some reason the computer won’t work unless it’s plugged in. I originally got it for college, but the pandemic caused me to stay and do school at home. I haven’t spilled anything or dropped the computer so I don’t know what the problem is., Nice PC but the backlighting went out after 3 weeks and Acer couldn't help me. Having a laptop without being able to see the keys is not good., Bought one year ago, already falling apart. Lacks durability.  Good for a few months, then you'll need a new one.  The input to the power cord is broken and now the laptop won't charge.  The lever that opens and closes the laptop pulled apart. Stay away.  Terrible quality., I baught this laptop and after just a month and a half the mouse pad won't work. Scam, ALL ELSE OK, I regret buying this laptop and spending all the extra money in shipping.I am having two major troubles with this laptop:1 - The laptop slows down and lags badly once unplugged from power. It runs fast and fine when plugged. It's so bad. I have gone to Control panel and under power settings created a different profile for high performance and gone to advanced power settings and set everything to high performance and still the issue persists.I upgraded the RAM to 16GB. Same issue. I have done countless troubleshooting as seen on different websites, my windows is updated. I have switched off most background and start-up apps and it's still same. I just don't understand why I can't have the freedom to use my laptop at high performance when unplugged. This is crazy. I'm suspecting AMD and Acer to be behind this. This issue sometimes doesn't happen but most times it does.2. Second issue is that when connected to hotspot, this device will from time to time shut off internet connection for not obvious reason.So I could be in the middle of an important zoom meeting and off she goes.Don't buy this if you want peace of mind. The back cover also is inferior plastic., Considering I had a Toshiba laptop for over 10 years with no problems, I expected better of this. But two months into it the touch pad and cursor died. Fortunately I still had the wireless mouse and keyboard so the laptop is still functional.I don't have the time or patience to fool around with a return. When I buy a product I expect it to work. We'll see how long it lasts., Track pad broke within 1 month of use. Amazon was no help., Extremely happy with this. I have a laptop i can take on the go for long business trips even upgraded the ram to make it even better. Glad i found this.  "

       "      <td>I’ll admit I was very skeptical from reviews but I decided to purchase anyways…. and so far so good! Battery life is about 7 hours of constant use (games, videos, etc). Sounds is good. I had no problems connecting to internet. The border of the phone did appear to have some scratches but not too many., The phone I received has a loose charging port that should have been replaced. It was at 27% just now and I plugged it in and opened an app. Now it just gave me the under 20% notification so it’s obviously struggling to keep the cord in place., No working well can't download any apps horrible phone My old Android works better than this junk. Please refund money. Diana Manuele, It’s for personal and the battery life issues is crazy it’s only take 2 hours, Worked slow, barely charged., Battery life is not good at all. Only last an hour., The worse I never bought. Battery is dead and I sent it in Africa, so no way to return it. Just lost my money. I could give 0 star, I’m very picky with my phone cases which means I keep buying them until I find one that’s jut right. This phone case has everything I’m looking for. It’s not to bulky and has a slim fit. It’s enclosed and has a built in screen protector. The front plastic trim doesn’t cover top and bottom front of the Like some cases making the screen “appear” smaller.The rubber is stiff and durable and not like those cheap ones the stretch out over time.One reviewer stated they had to keep taking it apart to get the moister out. Well this is NOT a waterproof case and if it was it would be heavier and bulkier. I’m wondering how that much moister is getting in ther in the 1st place. Are you bathing with it? Tip: instead of drenching the phone with cleaning solution then wiping it up, try spraying the cleaning solution on the rag itself (just enough to coat it) then use that to clean the screen.Another reviewer stated the back falls off. If you don’t snap it in correctly this will happen. Solution: go to an arts and crafts store or fabric store and ask for some double sided hem tape. It’s very thin and extremely strong. It will keep that back on if it’s a defect., Phone broke a little after a month. Was only given a small % back on return and was never told why after multiple emails. Do not buy!!!!, Phone appeared to be flawless when it arrived. It stopped recognizing any sim card after 3 months. even though it was a few days out of warranty when it died the seller still took it back for a full refund., Too small in size, The phone looks great. However, the battery life was 70% instead of the promised 80%. This means that the battery dies very quickly, even when fully charged. We attempted to contact the seller but received no response. We would have settled for an exchange, but again, no response. Looks like we have to buy a battery, add another $50 to the price to get a fully refurbished phone. Very disappointed., Hey- it’s an iPhone. I did have to buy ear buds for this unit as none came with it.The phone is OK, but the battery is horrible., GSM does not work. This version of IPhone cannot be repaired. I stop being able to update, because it does not connect to the local network. It is WITHOUT SERVICE ... that is, now it helps me to connect only by wifi and to listen to music ... Battery drains from 100 to 0 in 2 hours of use  The battery is at 50%? I mean, impossible to use it. Lousy purchase They should withdraw it from circulation to these iPhone 7, Phone came in on 86 battery life and touch screen doesn’t like to work, wouldn’t recommend this phone., phone works great, but battery needs replacement, per the iPhone settings screen, just over 3 months after purchase. Does not hold charge for long even with all settings optimized, not using GPS in background etc. Otherwise price was reasonable., The phone battery was supposed to be at 80% or better but this battery only 77% and Apple saying need to replace battery now. It's too bad vendors don't install new batteries and increase the price because changing these batteries is not fun as you can have screen damage and broken wires. Aside from that very happy with phone and fast delivery., Good condition, but instantly overheats when charge. Not sure if that’s normal but the body of it great condition, This IPhone 7 gets really hot as soon as you charge it . Also it charges slow ,, The phone is unlocked no scratches , no flaws . Came right on clear. Packaged for fragile item very well. My daughter loves her new phone., It is hard to buy from a third party and it not working is frustrating., My review is half bad and half good. It came in almost a week, which I was crazy waiting for it. I was so happy when it got here! I checked the battery capacity and it only charges to 62, which was so disappointing. It charges really fast, but loses a lot of percent quick. Other than that everything was good. It came with a charger and charger block., I ordered from Trademore to get a refurbished iPhone 7, and it arrived fully ready to go out of the box with the latest iOS version installed. All I needed to do was add in my SIM chip and sign on with my Apple ID, and iCloud Backup restore did the rest. The unit I received works like new and was actually flat (as opposed to some other refurbs I've had); it had some scratching on the glass, but not over the actual display area. Trademore and Amazon refurbs may seemed more expensive than refurbs from elsewhere, but it's worth it for a great unit with no hassles or technical gotchas., It took a while for this to become an issue. At first I was restarting the phone which I thought was fixing the problem but the proximity sensor does not function properly. As a result, when I attempt to talk on a call, the screen remains lit and the side of my face continually hits the buttons, resulting in frustration for both me and the caller. It's impossible to hold a voice call at this point. Unfortunately, by the time I realized what the problem is, the phone isn't eligible for a refund., Easy to use, I got my iphone 7 opened it was fine owner didnt factor reset it i turned it on an it was on home screen.Works well i like it!! 8/10 😃, batter health was at 70 not the promised 80., Bad phones you are not honest, I bought this for a July gift.  It stopped working 8 months later.  It would no longer receive a cellular signal.  It took about a week to troubleshoot with the mobile carrier before they said it must be your phone.  I took it to a phone repair shop and they said the motherboard crashed. 😩, So I got this phone, when it originally came, it had more damage than what was listed so I returned it. The next one that came in had little to no damage so I was excited. However, after the 30 day return window (of course) the phone has been having all sorts of problems. I have audio issues with my phone on speaker, the keyboard gets stuck constantly, and the battery life is pretty much non-existent. Incredibly pissed I bought this for 230$ and now can only get 60$ if I sell it back. Just a warning, but if you buy your phone from here you are gambling with your money honestly. So just do a payment plan through your provider or get it from apple and spare yourself the frustration, Died every 20 minutes and constantly shut off and if it was colder than 50 degrees it would not turn on., I’m disappointed with this phone’s battery life. I have to make sure I keep a charger with me everywhere I go. This is my first experience with an iPhone so maybe that is how they are, I don’t know., This was in good condition and battery life good., Seller guarantees 80% battery. Received phone with battery capacity of only 75%. Seller never replied to follow up messages and only offered a $20 credit and never replied when alternatives were requested., Bought this refurbished iPhone for our daughter.  We like the parental controls that Apple offers.  We aren't going to buy her a new expensive phone so it is nice to get a used one from Amazon., Overall good product! The cameras kind of glitches at times but it overall works. The battery dies very quickly, but it works perfectly fine even without a sim card. Very good product!, I just got this  for my middle school son in time for school to start. It needed charging upon arrival, but the charging cord/plug that came with it did not work. Luckily this  is a replacement phone, and we have other chargers in the house and so were able to get it charged.It's working so far. I can't comment on battery life yet because it's too soon. The phone appeared to be in excellent condition., Overall satisfied with iPhone 7 transaction: the phone arrived in pristine physical condition--I could not find a scratch on it.The battery however had 78% capacity, not the 80% advertised. Not sure it would have made a difference as this phone was for my 12 year old son and in the end I decided to replace the battery (which granted is not for everyone as it's not a 5-minute process - more like an hour and 44 minutes process).Was able to successfully change the battery and all is well. So, net-net was able to get a like-new iPhone 7 for under $200.Recommend this vendor but do know if you are not comfortable swapping in a new battery you'll be charging your phone 2-3 times a day as normal phone usage will deplete the battery quickly., I like everything I don’t dislike nothing, Fine, I like is because it was a easy set up and everything was good on it, i have to go to apple because i got this phone for verizon and it wont let me make calls or texts sooooo basically dont buy it, I was pleasantly surprised after reading a few not-so-good reviews ... but the iphone 7 (Verizon) that I received looked like it was brand new.  It was packaged very nicely in a custom box with a new charging cable and AC converter.  Not a single scratch on it, \"battery health\" was rated at 84% and everything worked perfectly.  Frankly, I can't imagine why someone actually traded this in for a new phone????  But I'm glad they did.  My daughter (currently my Tech Support person) was sweet enough to get me a very nice \"Youmaker\" protector for it ... she knows I'm a bit clumsy.  I've only had this phone for a few weeks but so far so good.  I even use it for visual control (FPV) on a few of my quads/drones ... it is remarkable how well the battery holds up for that video on 10-15 minute flights ... much better than my old iphone.  Very glad I bought this., Runs slow , colabirtation is off and screen glitches, Battery life is insufficient and less than expected., Phone came fast and everything is good but the battery only holds a charge for about an hour when it’s not charging pretty annoyed about this., Bad battery life junk charger, just buy new instead of having to do it anyways, Home button non functional., Wasn't bad came in good condition., If I can fit everything I didn’t like about this phone into this box I would detail it.But whoever replaced the screen did a horrible jobWon’t register any SIM cards to any carrierIt looks like I bought it from wish.com, There’s a black line when trying to take pictures, takes horrible pictures, The phone is used and it doesn’t earphones, Everything was great. Like brand new!, Like many, read a lot of bad reviews... Was worried that there would be major issues upon getting the phone. HOWEVER, my phone showed up next day, SUPER FAST. Opened up the packaging and the iphone 7 looked very very good. Couple very tiny scuffs, but was expecting such as it is a USED phone would give it a 9/10 and i'm picky. Called my phone provider and they were able to switch it to my number no problem. I have sprint, which has merged with t mobile. I got the FULLY UNLOCKED phone, for anyone wondering. After running the phone through all its tests, everything is in proper working order. Battery life is at 84% which is fine by me. Higher than the stated number of 80% anyways. Never really payed attention to that stuff on the other phones i have had. All i can say is that the phone is doing everything it should and I am very happy with it. If there is one concern, the phone may be running a hair warm, but nothing to seem worried about momentarily. I will update this post at any point in the next 6 months if need be, but so far so good. COMPANY I WENT WITH: TECH EXCHANGEE NY, screen had a small crack and a chip  and the back has some marks on it and the home button is difficult to make contact. however the phone does work., Cord does not work!, This device only worked for 6 months and it started decaying. I send it to apple and they stated that it will need a new motherboard., This was for personal use the phone has been nothing but trouble since the day we got it. Will not make calls or will make calls on its own we don’t even when we’re not even trying. Need to know if there is insurance on this purchase Or is there any kind of warranty on this purchase, Item came without a charger, I have been using my phone for about a month, from what I have been able to assess so far the phone has been working properly, the battery holds fairly well, unless playing a game on the phone it drains the battery pretty quickly. The Siri function, the finger print unlock, and camera are pretty amazing, and they are some of the many things that I did not have on my iPhone 4...so this is a wonderful upgrade for me!, Very average product! Must have been used for couple of years before reselling it. Battery life was at 80% when arrived. Good purchase if one wants to buy iPhone at cheap price, Phone works great i have to say no problems so far 5/5, Have this phone just over six months it glitches, turns off all the time, battery drains fast, phone won't shut off even when the battery is at 98%.  The amount of money I spent on it I should have gotten more than 6 months use, wouldn't recommend., The phone  barley work can’t call nobody can’t text nobody, Why it dies so fast ?, It’s ok, It’s a good phone over all but often freezes or hangs up calls on its own. Dies very fast! Annoying., The stop working in 2 weeks, Extremely scratched and banged up. Shouldn't have passed quality control. Unless the standards are that low, Perfect condition, The battery on my other phone was only lasting me from 7 am - 1 pm so I figured I would get a new phone - The new phone is lasting from 7 am - 11am and says the battery is 100% healthy...., Worst purchase ever don't waste time on this item does not even turn on turns mad hot 1st day on arrival does not turn on 2nd day return hopefully all turn out good with money back update later on, Phone has no signal, Antenna broke internally on phone within 4 months just outside the 3 month return window.  Worked great until then., i liked it except for the fact that the back had some dints in it and u can’t turn it on silent mood, Look good, Speaker are not working, Arrived a day early which is usually nice, but I planned my schedule around it arriving on the estimated delivery date. It had obvious wear on the back and there was a small blotch on the screen that must've been dead pixels or something because it was pure white regardless of what was on the screen. I didn't like it in this condition, so I returned it and they said they would deduct return shipping cost from my refund but they ended up not doing that., The phone I received did not have a working microphone. Couldn’t record or make calls. The company issued me a full refund. They have great customer service but sold a faulty device so I gave a neutral rating., Honestly I was so nervous to buy a phone from Amazon for the 7 year old stepson ... but reviews can be very deceiving .. phone worked GREAT !! Now if I can only get this 7 year old to come back to earth and stay off the phone lol needles to say he loves it ..., The phone doesn’t work. I can hear a person I call, but they can’t hear me., I loved this phone for about a half a year and loved it! However, I got a message saying my SIM card could not be read. Turns out that this is a known iPhone mistake when iPhones are built. When I brought it to the Apple store they said that because it was originally made in Japan they could not fix it or send me a new one. I am now out for a new phone. However it worked very well when it did, I just wouldn’t risk it., My battery dies way too soon. The package also arrived much later than expected and also had a decent scratch in the screen deep enough to affect the overall appearance. The camera works just as expected but it definitely was not the “new” look you can definitely see the precious wear and tear on the iphone., No work for Verizon, Great phone thank you, i was confused by the packet  i received with item, it said iphone 5s - i was ready to return(im a new iphone user) i was kinda disappointed with charger not working - had to buy additional one to use phone - overall its a great item -, The phone was very nice looking phone, but I had to return the  phone due to it was not compatible with my sprint network service., The phone constantly restarts itself. The battery lasts all of 10 minutes. I do not recommend buying a phone from this company.. they’re junk., I've only had this Iphone 7 a few days. The reason I bought it is because my previous Iphone wouldn't hold a charge for more than a few hours. So far this Iphone will hold a charge for 2 days with moderate use. I'm happy with it so far. The charger that came with it did not work but I still have my previous Iphone charger that did work. Other than that I am happy with it. It didn't have any scratches or anything and looks brand new., This review is for the seller Hybrid IT. First of all, I wasn’t expecting it to come as fast as it did. I ordered my phone Friday at 3 AM and received it Saturday by 12 PM, that’s kind of insane since they are in NY and i’m in FL. There are a few small scuffs on the bottom of the device near the speaker but otherwise it’s pretty close to perfect cosmetically. The screen has no scratches at all, i can’t tell if it’s the original but if it was replaced they did a hell of a job. The max battery capacity is 100%. it came with a charger but no headphones or headphone adapter so you will need to buy one. i haven’t experienced any issues so far but it’s only been a day so i will make sure to come back and give an update.Also if you have Metro by TMobile and you’re having trouble getting service after inserting your SIM, you have to register the phone with them before it will work, not sure about other carriers. for a second i thought i received a locked/stolen phone but i wanted to make sure. don’t give up unless the carrier actually tells you it won’t work. you can try calling the customer service number and doing it with the automated system or a representative but if you don’t have access to your old phone you need to go into the store. It took 5 minutes and only costs $15-20 depending on where you live.Overall i’m extremely pleased, it was a risk but i’m happy i seem to have gotten a good device. Thankful for all the reviews recommending to buy from this seller., The maximum capacity of the battery was on 74% when I received the phone. I can only use the phone for a few hours before the battery is completely dead. Other than them sending it with a bad battery the phone works great., DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!! I got this in today after looking for a good phone for my son for about 2 months the home button didn't work and you can't use Verizon it is not Amazon renewed its a scam, Phone is ok, no marks or scratches, but came with outdated ios that needed to be updated prior to transferring data from old phone.  Battery life isn't great., There are times when a phone is set to support another carrier, and even after a full factory reset, any carrier update will kill your mobile network.  Happened to me.  Sprint/T-mobile reset it and tried multiple times, and every time we got it to work, it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a day.That means no calls, no text, no internet if you're outside of wifi.Be warned and keep your old phone handy.  You may be disappointed like i was., Every renewed phone I’ve gotten before this one had a renewed battery. This one did not. Will have to get one soon, phone charge only last a few hours. Would not have bought it if I would have known the battery was not renewed., ok, It was good phone till a month after purchase kinda salty about it still wish i didnt spend on the phone also did not come with the right charger, I like the condition of the phone. It really looks as good as new.The problem is on the earphones plug. Should provide the adapter., The phone was ok. I had a few issues but nothing major., Gof a great product. Fast response, Phone worked great for about 6 months. Then it stopped connecting to the cellular service. Trying to update it and the phone says that I can’t. Called Apple support and they can’t do anything since phone is no longer under warranty., Everything was good except the battery came to me at 80% capacity.  So when it charges to 💯 it’s never better than 80%.  The seller offered me a 20.00 credit but I can’t find an authorized dealer to change the battery.  🤷‍♀️, This phone is almost perfect!!! The only thing about this device is that I can’t get it turned on due to the fact that it won’t accept a SIM card. I found this misleading due to the fact that they told me my device was renewed and compatible with certain carriers., Nice piece, My son loves it. Arrived quick, looks new, &amp; works great! He’s been smiling since, Received the phone in the usual blank white box refurbs come in, shipping was fast and it came with an android charger block and a no name lightning cable.Phone came with one long deep scratch, a cracked home button, and a couple other much smaller nicks and scratches, enough that it was off putting for me. Battery life showed 92% which is excellent however the phone did seem to lag after only my second week with it.Phone was unlocked as stated and I had no issues switching in my sim and using the phone right away. Overall a decent phone but I will be returning it because of the the cracked Touch ID button and deep scratches, The phone does not work properly it heats up so hot every time we try and use it ., Gift good condtion, A good way to get a new iPhone at a good price, The battery is useless, it takes 3 hours of use to fully recharge, needs to be replaced, All seemed as expected from the seller and from description except battery life was not 80% or above as stated in listing but 70%.The biggest issue with this was having to pay, send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promised.This just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending, then what else are they not checking with these phones., Didn’t come with any kind of paperwork and it’s working but the touchscreen can freeze up at times., Although i was very happy to get a much needed upgrade from my old 5s and this was just the right size there were a couple of things i was not satisfied with and almost sent the phone back. First of all Amazon stated the battery would be able to be charged at a minimum of 80% its original capacity mine was not it was around 75% i figured ok well i suppose i could live with that but amazon also states that there will be no visible blemishes on the phone viewed from 12 inches that was not the case with mine the finish on one of the rear corners about a half inch the entire corner of the phone was completely wore off once again i decided I could live with that since it is the rear and would be covered with the case. Overall im happy with the speed and functionality of the phone though and the screen camera and everything work great. I’m not happy that i will end up putting another 50 to 100 dollars into a phone that cost me about 200 in order to get a new full capacity battery that lasts longer for media and extended use, Daughter loves it, No fingerprints reader and the phone Glitches a lot, I was switching phones because the one I was using had a battery that was starting to die. However this one does just as quickly and got so hot it almost hurt to hold it., I just opened this product and charged it fully for two hours and unplugged it. As I’m sitting here on my old phone to port over my SIM card credentials, the battery went from 100 to 88% within 8 minutes. I just saw the numbers dropping right before my eyes. The phone transfer and condition are really good but the battery is terrible. I wish the guarantee included a new battery. (Health is reading at 83% out of the box)., The phone is very small., BATTERY LIFE NOT AS ADVERTISED  ONLY 56%NO ANSWER FROM SELLER, The phone looked good function well but was defective it had something loose inside and I had return it, I’d definitely buy again. This the real deal fr. Y’all should try them out! I got my money’s worth ., The battery life last about 2 to 3 hours., Great phone, defiantly recommend. It’s a little weird at times like it takes a while to turn on after it dies sometimes and I can’t have certain pictures as my screensaver for some reason. It would black out parts of it but I only had that problem with two of my pictures. Other than that for a refurbished phone it’s pretty good., I've boughten iPhones from amazon before, two different iPhone 6s. This time, I could only find iPhone 7, so if figured \"why not?\". I'll tell you why, this seller sent a defective phone. It worked perfectly the first day, and then 24 hours later it told me I needed to update it or else my cellular data wouldn't work (which means I could not receive or send any texts or calls!). Sure enough, I updated it, and it worked, for another few hours, until it said it needed ANOTHER UPDATE! Unfortunately, it was already up to date as it could be. So I took it in to the \"geniuses\" at APPLE, and they said THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH iPhone 7, YOU NEED TO REPLACE IT. And that was it. Returning, hopefully that goes smoothly. Avoid iPhone 7, too sketchy., excellent product</td>\n",

replacement phone and we have other chargers in the house and so were able to get it chargedit is working so far i cannot comment on battery life yet because it is too soon the phone appeared to be in excellent condition overall satisfied with iphone 7 transaction the phone arrived in pristine physical conditioni could not find a scratch on itthe battery however had 78 capacity not the 80 advertised not sure it would have made a difference as this phone was for my 12 year old son and in the end i decided to replace the battery which granted is not for everyone as it is not a 5minute process more like an hour and 44 minutes processwas able to successfully change the battery and all is well so netnet was able to get a likenew iphone 7 for under 200recommend this vendor but do know if you are not comfortable swapping in a new battery you will be charging your phone 23 times a day as normal phone usage will deplete the battery quickly i like everything i do not dislike nothing fine i like is because it was a easy set up and everything was good on it i have to go to apple because i got this phone for verizon and it will not let me make calls or texts sooooo basically do not buy it i was pleasantly surprised after reading a few notsogood reviews but the iphone 7 verizon that i received looked like it was brand new it was packaged very nicely in a custom box with a new charging cable and ac converter not a single scratch on it battery health was rated at 84 and everything worked perfectly frankly i cannot imagine why someone actually traded this in for a new phone but i am glad they did my daughter currently my tech support person was sweet enough to get me a very nice youmaker protector for it she knows i am a bit clumsy i have only had this phone for a few weeks but so far so good i even use it for visual control fpv on a few of my quadsdrones it is remarkable how well the battery holds up for that video on 1015 minute flights much better than my old iphone very glad i bought this runs slow colabirtation is off and screen glitches battery life is insufficient and less than expected phone came fast and everything is good but the battery only holds a charge for about an hour when it is not charging pretty annoyed about this bad battery life junk charger just buy new instead of having to do it anyways home button non functional was not bad came in good condition if i can fit everything i did not like about this phone into this box i would detail itbut whoever replaced the screen did a horrible jobwont register any sim cards to any carrierit looks like i bought it from wishcom there is a black line when trying to take pictures takes horrible pictures the phone is used and it does not earphones everything was great like brand new like many read a lot of bad reviews was worried that there would be major issues upon getting the phone however my phone showed up next day super fast opened up the packaging and the iphone 7 looked very very good couple very tiny scuffs but was expecting such as it is a used phone would give it a 910 and i am picky called my phone provider and they were able to switch it to my number no problem i have sprint which has merged with t mobile i got the fully unlocked phone for anyone wondering after running the phone through all its tests everything is in proper working order battery life is at 84 which is fine by me higher than the stated number of 80 anyways never really payed attention to that stuff on the other phones i have had all i can say is that the phone is doing everything it should and i am very happy with it if there is one concern the phone may be running a hair warm but nothing to seem worried about momentarily i will update this post at any point in the next 6 months if need be but so far so good company i went with tech exchangee ny screen had a small crack and a chip and the back has some marks on it and the home button is difficult to make contact however the phone does work cord does not work this device only worked for 6 months and it started decaying i send it to apple and they stated that it will need a new motherboard this was for personal use the phone has been nothing but trouble since the day we got it will not make calls or will make calls on its own we do not even when we are not even trying need to know if there is insurance on this purchase or is there any kind of warranty on this purchase item came without a charger i have been using my phone for about a month from what i have been able to assess so far the phone has been working properly the battery holds fairly well unless playing a game on the phone it drains the battery pretty quickly the siri function the finger print unlock and camera are pretty amazing and they are some of the many things that i did not have on my iphone 4so this is a wonderful upgrade for me very average product must have been used for couple of years before reselling it battery life was at 80 when arrived good purchase if one wants to buy iphone at cheap price phone works great i have to say no problems so far 55 have this phone just over six months it glitches turns off all the time battery drains fast phone will not shut off even when the battery is at 98 the amount of money i spent on it i should have gotten more than 6 months use would not recommend the phone barley work cannot call nobody cannot text nobody why it dies so fast it is ok it is a good phone over all but often freezes or hangs up calls on its own dies very fast annoying the stop working in 2 weeks extremely scratched and banged up should not have passed quality control unless the standards are that low perfect condition the battery on my other phone was only lasting me from 7 am 1 pm so i figured i would get a new phone the new phone is lasting from 7 am 11am and says the battery is 100 healthy worst purchase ever do not waste time on this item does not even turn on turns mad hot 1st day on arrival does not turn on 2nd day return hopefully all turn out good with money back update later on phone has no signal antenna broke internally on phone within 4 months just outside the 3 month return window worked great until then i liked it except for the fact that the back had some dints in it and you cannot turn it on silent mood look good speaker are not working arrived a day early which is usually nice but i planned my schedule around it arriving on the estimated delivery date it had obvious wear on the back and there was a small blotch on the screen that must have been dead pixels or something because it was pure white regardless of what was on the screen i did not like it in this condition so i returned it and they said they would deduct return shipping cost from my refund but they ended up not doing that the phone i received did not have a working microphone could not record or make calls the company issued me a full refund they have great customer service but sold a faulty device so i gave a neutral rating honestly i was so nervous to buy a phone from amazon for the 7 year old stepson but reviews can be very deceiving phone worked great now if i can only get this 7 year old to come back to earth and stay off the phone lol needles to say he loves it the phone does not work i can hear a person i call but they cannot hear me i loved this phone for about a half a year and loved it however i got a message saying my sim card could not be read turns out that this is a known iphone mistake when iphones are built when i brought it to the apple store they said that because it was originally made in japan they could not fix it or send me a new one i am now out for a new phone however it worked very well when it did i just would not risk it my battery dies way too soon the package also arrived much later than expected and also had a decent scratch in the screen deep enough to affect the overall appearance the camera works just as expected but it definitely was not the new look you can definitely see the precious wear and tear on the iphone no work for verizon great phone thank you i was confused by the packet i received with item it said iphone 5s i was ready to returni am a new iphone user i was kind of disappointed with charger not working had to buy additional one to use phone overall its a great item the phone was very nice looking phone but i had to return the phone due to it was not compatible with my sprint network service the phone constantly restarts itself the battery lasts all of 10 minutes i do not recommend buying a phone from this company they are junk i have only had this iphone 7 a few days the reason i bought it is because my previous iphone would not hold a charge for more than a few hours so far this iphone will hold a charge for 2 days with moderate use i am happy with it so far the charger that came with it did not work but i still have my previous iphone charger that did work other than that i am happy with it it did not have any scratches or anything and looks brand new this review is for the seller hybrid it first of all i was not expecting it to come as fast as it did i ordered my phone friday at 3 am and received it saturday by 12 pm that is kind of insane since they are in ny and i am in fl there are a few small scuffs on the bottom of the device near the speaker but otherwise it is pretty close to perfect cosmetically the screen has no scratches at all i cannot tell if it is the original but if it was replaced they did a hell of a job the max battery capacity is 100 it came with a charger but no headphones or headphone adapter so you will need to buy one i have not experienced any issues so far but it is only been a day so i will make sure to come back and give an updatealso if you have metro by tmobile and you are having trouble getting service after inserting your sim you have to register the phone with them before it will work not sure about other carriers for a second i thought i received a lockedstolen phone but i wanted to make sure do not give up unless the carrier actually tells you it will not work you can try calling the customer service number and doing it with the automated system or a representative but if you do not have access to your old phone you need to go into the store it took 5 minutes and only costs 1520 depending on where you liveoverall i am extremely pleased it was a risk but i am happy i seem to have gotten a good device thankful for all the reviews recommending to buy from this seller the maximum capacity of the battery was on 74 when i received the phone i can only use the phone for a few hours before the battery is completely dead other than them sending it with a bad battery the phone works great do not buy this phone i got this in today after looking for a good phone for my son for about 2 months the home button did not work and you cannot use verizon it is not amazon renewed its a scam phone is ok no marks or scratches but came with outdated ios that needed to be updated prior to transferring data from old phone battery life is not great there are times when a phone is set to support another carrier and even after a full factory reset any carrier update will kill your mobile network happened to me sprinttmobile reset it and tried multiple times and every time we got it to work it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a daythat means no calls no text no internet if you are outside of wifibe warned and keep your old phone handy you may be disappointed like i was every renewed phone i have gotten before this one had a renewed battery this one did not will have to get one soon phone charge only last a few hours would not have bought it if i would have known the battery was not renewed ok it was good phone till a month after purchase kind of salty about it still wish i did not spend on the phone also did not come with the right charger i like the condition of the phone it really looks as good as newthe problem is on the earphones plug should provide the adapter the phone was ok i had a few issues but nothing major gof a great product fast response phone worked great for about 6 months then it stopped connecting to the cellular service trying to update it and the phone says that i cannot called apple support and they cannot do anything since phone is no longer under warranty everything was good except the battery came to me at 80 capacity so when it charges to it is never better than 80 the seller offered me a 2000 credit but i cannot find an authorized dealer to change the battery this phone is almost perfect the only thing about this device is that i cannot get it turned on due to the fact that it will not accept a sim card i found this misleading due to the fact that they told me my device was renewed and compatible with certain carriers nice piece my son loves it arrived quick looks new works great he is been smiling since received the phone in the usual blank white box refurbs come in shipping was fast and it came with an android charger block and a no name lightning cablephone came with one long deep scratch a cracked home button and a couple other much smaller nicks and scratches enough that it was off putting for me battery life showed 92 which is excellent however the phone did seem to lag after only my second week with itphone was unlocked as stated and i had no issues switching in my sim and using the phone right away overall a decent phone but i will be returning it because of the the cracked touch id button and deep scratches the phone does not work properly it heats up so hot every time we try and use it gift good condtion a good way to get a new iphone at a good price the battery is useless it takes 3 hours of use to fully recharge needs to be replaced all seemed as expected from the seller and from description except battery life was not 80 or above as stated in listing but 70the biggest issue with this was having to pay send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promisedthis just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending then what else are they not checking with these phones did not come with any kind of paperwork and it is working but the touchscreen can freeze up at times although i was very happy to get a much needed upgrade from my old 5s and this was just the right size there were a couple of things i was not satisfied with and almost sent the phone back first of all amazon stated the battery would be able to be charged at a minimum of 80 its original capacity mine was not it was around 75 i figured ok well i suppose i could live with that but amazon also states that there will be no visible blemishes on the phone viewed from 12 inches that was not the case with mine the finish on one of the rear corners about a half inch the entire corner of the phone was completely wore off once again i decided i could live with that since it is the rear and would be covered with the case overall i am happy with the speed and functionality of the phone though and the screen camera and everything work great i am not happy that i will end up putting another 50 to 100 dollars into a phone that cost me about 200 in order to get a new full capacity battery that lasts longer for media and extended use daughter loves it no fingerprints reader and the phone glitches a lot i was switching phones because the one i was using had a battery that was starting to die however this one does just as quickly and got so hot it almost hurt to hold it i just opened this product and charged it fully for two hours and unplugged it as i am sitting here on my old phone to port over my sim card credentials the battery went from 100 to 88 within 8 minutes i just saw the numbers dropping right before my eyes the phone transfer and condition are really good but the battery is terrible i wish the guarantee included a new battery health is reading at 83 out of the box the phone is very small battery life not as advertised only 56no answer from seller the phone looked good function well but was defective it had something loose inside and i had return it i would definitely buy again this the real deal fr you all should try them out i got my moneys worth the battery life last about 2 to 3 hours great phone defiantly recommend it is a little weird at times like it takes a while to turn on after it dies sometimes and i cannot have certain pictures as my screensaver for some reason it would black out parts of it but i only had that problem with two of my pictures other than that for a refurbished phone it is pretty good i have boughten iphones from amazon before two different iphone 6s this time i could only find iphone 7 so if figured why not i will tell you why this seller sent a defective phone it worked perfectly the first day and then 24 hours later it told me i needed to update it or else my cellular data would not work which means i could not receive or send any texts or calls sure enough i updated it and it worked for another few hours until it said it needed another update unfortunately it was already up to date as it could be so i took it in to the geniuses at apple and they said this is a common problem with iphone 7 you need to replace it and that was it returning hopefully that goes smoothly avoid iphone 7 too sketchy excellent product</td>\n",

       "      <td>It’s thick, but works good once you get used to it!, These base and top coats work great for an at home gel mani-pedi. My only issue was when i tried to soak and scrape it off, it seemed like the base layer bonded almost TOO well with my nail, and part of my nail layers scraped off. I had to take a few months break between the next gel manicure because my nails were damaged. This could just be user error or the fact that my nails are extremely thin. They held up great though, and looked beautiful., the product works great, the only reason i didn’t give five stars was because it smells TERRIBLE. like a skunk almost and it’s very strong. but it works, and works well., I would buy it again. Beats having to use nail polish remover in the end. Best quality I’ve ever used at home. Nails come out looking professional. Very easy to use. I recommend it., smells awful, While the polish is great, every bottle I've ever had from them, 4, ALL HAVE LEAKED when on their side., I love this product it’s very easy and it last for 14 days, Best brand for top coat and base!! My favorite one, Terrible product. The base coat seemed to work fine, but the top coat was in such a gel-like consistency that I couldn't even use it. No matter how hard I shook the bottle up, it remained the same. Waste of money. Only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the base coat worked. All in all, NOT HAPPY!!!, The base coat is horrible. You’re better off just buying the top coat only. Top coat is average I would say. I’ve done my manicures without the base and they come out better. The base causes the polish to look bumpy., Really cool that I can do this at home. Just light and done!, My top coat bottle came completely empty. I am returning for a replacement but it’s disappointing!, Poor quality, was only good the first few uses. Base coat became thick and does not go on smoothly at all. Product quality changes over very short time. Would not recommend. Both me and my sister are allergic to this product. After some use it causes nail bed pain and inflammation., It's great that you take a picture... but it helps if you show the door # !!! This was dropped off at 104!? NOT 106, I could not get the base coat to dry fully.  I used my UV light 5 times (5 min) and it was still tacky.  I gave up and went ahead and put polish over it anyway.  The polish I used thankfully was able to dry just fine.  The top coat seemed to dry much better but I won't be using this brand again., Overall this is a good set. It can be thick so be sure to wipe the brush on the side of the bottle before applying and when covering your nail. Make sure to use thinner coats and apply evenly or else you’ll see the lines/uneven levels after curing.For curing times, I have a UV LED lamp and wasn’t sure how long to cure for. Top coat 60 seconds is perfect. Cures hard and comes off easily when time to remove. For base coat I tried 60 seconds but was having a hard time when removing it, so I went down to 30 seconds and that seems to have helped., Top coat dried out in the bottle after 3 uses. Returned!, Perfect, Bottles came leaking from the top. The gel polish I got to go along with these two bottles was perfectly fine and intact. Why these leaked I don’t know. I haven’t used them yet either since most of the product was all over the box it came in., Top coat goes on nicely and leaves a nice shinny coat and is not sticky., Pretty easy to come because the polish came off within a week. I would have expected it to last at least 2 weeks., Very small but not too bad, Nice, not that good, This product worked amazingly well. After a minute under LED /UV it was dry. Very sheer and worked well with my polygel kit., First time trying this brand and my last. Very, very thin like a refusal polish, not hard at all. Nails broke easily. I do not recommend this brand., Great product, Amazing! Lasts the longest out of anything I’ve tried!, This is a peel off formula. I do follow all the instructions for application and I never use acetone to remove. I soak in water for a few minutes or just hand wash some dishes and I am able to peel of the polish most times I one piece. Now while that its awesome because it removes easily, the manicure does not last past 2 days with out major chipping., I used it the first time and it worked real good! but the second time was horrible, I could not get it to set correctly, it was in a way clumpy? it sucks because I really wanted to like it., Horrible product. Does not stay on. The top coat has a thick glue like consistency and does not spread on nail well. Peels off within a couple of days. So disappointed., Is just a oil, It is clumpy and didn’t even dry all the way through, now my nails are smudged.Está muy gruesa y no se secaron bien mis uñas., I ordered the base &amp; top coat about 4 years ago &amp; I loved it. I started doing my own nails again so I wanted to try it again...bad idea. The base coat works fine but the top coat started clumping &amp; was too thick &amp; this was only the first use. Maybe they’ve changed the polish since the last time I used it but I won’t be ordering it again., Works fine doesn’t last too long though., The base coat good, but the top coat is trash! Starts peeling the next day., Great base and tip coat!! Lasts atleast 3 weeks for me!!, Not even an Ounce, I have tried various steps in an effort to get this polish to last longer than 7 days. It doesn't matter what I do it chips and looks like crap and has to be changed by day 7. I bought this base and top with Amelie gel polish., The topcoat got extremely clumpy after the second use causing an unsmooth finish., I was super excited to get my gel polishes in with such fantastic ratings- unfortunately the product was so thick when i went to apply, it applied like a literal paste.  There is no good use for this polish and I would like a refund promptly., I love the no wipe too coat. Saves me some time., This brand doesn’t hold up, the shellac peels off a lot sooner then expected., seriously soooo good! i do my own gel nails/toes at home and this is by far the best set i’ve gotten. gel polish is definitely an art and takes a long time to master - if this set “lifts” you probably just aren’t doing your gel application correctly. these two are excellent! also added bonus you don’t need to wipe the top coat :), The item itself is good but the bottles are very very tiny. I wish they made them a little bigger for the price., This does what it says it will do and the top coat is not sticky at all when it sets. The only complaint I have is that if you try to close the bottle when there is polish on the brush and the polish gets onto the mouth of the bottle, the cap will actually shrink wrap onto the mouth of the bottle making it very hard to open! This has happened to me several times so now I make sure there is no polish on the outside of the mouth of the bottle and I try to close it very gently not tightly. Please be aware of how you close this nail polish otherwise it will take FOREVER TO OPEN when you want to use it again., I really loved this product for the first few months! But recently began to have an allergic reaction to the product! I'm bummed I have to switch it up now because its great quality. Not saying don't buy it-- but definitely be mindful!, Very good product. Will buy again., applies and cures well, but dulls your manicure significantly. Also the base coat is difficult to remove., Bought for my sister who does nails and she didn’t like it... sadly, I like the product it’s a good shine and it lasts about two weeks I was pleased., The gel has a murky purple coating during the day time. It glows green under UV light.  When comparing this top coat to my Kupa inc Top coat there is a huge difference in color. Kupa inc top coat is clear and the Aimeli has the Murky Purple coating., So in love with this gel. It is thick and gets into all the nooks and crannies. It was actually recommended by a nail tech on you tube (nailed by nikki) and I had to try.  So far I am loving this product!!! If you don't like thick gel this is not for you but trudt you won't regret this buy., Top coat does not wear well. Base coat works great!, Dislike, Great base and top coat for gel nails, Not bad I've ordered it several times wish they would sell a matte top gel with these too, I was scared at first because it Was still tacky after curing under UV light but I read it’s supposed to be so polish will stick. Continued with my nail routine and it turned out well! Really great product especially for the price!!, Great for beginners. Works well, I brought the polish the size of the bottle for what you pay is pretty small I don’t blink your eyes, This chips and peels off, about like regular nail polish.  It is nothing like \"gel nails\" that you get in the salon, which is what I was looking for., Top coat turns yellow after a few days. I have used the base and top coat 4 times so far, and every time my nails start turning yellow after a few days. I have tried different curing times and even wiped the top coat after, but nothing seems to fix it. This has never happened with other brands of gel top coat I have used., Worked pretty good, good product for the price ! I usually get opi but this did the job, This was great for the price. Only issue was it did chip in some nails but that may have been true to operator error, I may not have cured the polish long enough. All in all I’m happy with my purchase. Also, arrived a lot sooner than I had anticipated., This! I can’t even begin! This is an amazing base and top coat my nails lasted! It was easy to use, and great for gels!I love it, This is my first gel base and top coat so I really don't have anything to compare it to., This must be a cheaper brand or the base coat is just bad. I have been using file off gel polish and I was noticing that I have a problem not damaging my nail when filing it off. It wasn't killing my nails, but I figured soak off would case me to do less accidental damage.I bought this brand because it was prime available and somewhat inexpensive. In a week I have had two nails (one on each hand) peel completely off. Its not like the free edge got loose. It just was really lifted in the middle or edge where it frowns in, and the loose polish would get peeled up to an awkward place where I had to remove it or it would peel even more off the top layer of my nails. One happened in just 3 days. THREE DAYS. I fixed those two jankity nails and I also added a second coat of just the top coat to all of my nails after 1 week. I can't tell if the top coat is better or not.Now this does have a perk. Its super easy to soak off and remove. Like wow it removes like butter. But, if its coming off super easy because it falls off of a well prepped nail in less than a week, this is a problem. I can now see why this has some lower ratings and why people would spend at least double on a widely known US name brand. Will I use the rest of teh bottle? Yes. I am cheap! I also like changing my nail polish color frequently if I can pull that off. This soaks off so easy that I could totally change my polish all the time. But, it also just falls off which means when I am too busy to do a manicure once a week this just flat out sucks.Edit: I have updated this review because after sitting and soaking off the polish I am really happy with how my nails look. They aren't damaged or sad looking. It really did just bubble up and off. This wouldn't be my choice for wearing before going on vacation or trying to wear for weeks in a row since it doesn't bubble up and come off easily, but if you like to change your nail color a couple of times a week you will be happy with this polish.8/8 Update: I keep trying this base/top coat FOOLISHLY because I have it. It keeps performing poorly. Polish just pops off within a day or two of application.  Just spend more and get Gelish. Even with shrinkage at least it stays on the nail better. Its my own fault for trying it again, but good grief., Peels easy, This basecoat is whack. Upon applying it, it’s separated like crazy. When I applied my gel color over top it also would separate on top until the second or third layer when it evened out. The topcoat is great, not tacky once it’s been cured and works as advertised., Top coat and base coat is very thick hard to apply thin.  Took forever to cure and was sticky had to put under the led light a lot longer than suggested to cure and then my thumb completely peeled off, This is the worst gel I've ever used. Doesnt really fully harden.  Peels off. Not durable at all. Do not reccommend!!, Not good dont buy this, This item is a great price for the two bottles. And it a product that I like because of the no wipe top coat, and it give a nice shiny finish., Easy to use and has a nice longevity! Impressed with the quality., Not so well, I used this base and top coat with the Gellen polish brand. This stuff works great- top coat is very glossy and dries fast with the UV lamp. Like instantly dry. I’ve had these nails for 2 weeks and the gloss wore off a smidge but that’s expected after 2 weeks. Still hasn’t chipped or lost ALL glossiness. I recommended this brand to 2 friends. Overall great purchase! I will be buying the colors next., I am reasonably new to gel nails and this was my first set of top and base, which I bought as Amazon reccommended it. I am fully aware of how long it takes to remove gel, but this stuff DOES NOT COME OFF. An hour of working at it every manicure with sandpaper, bowls of acetone, and wraps, and it just does not budge. Yet, it manages to lift along my cuticle line after a week and a half. Buy something higher quality and experiment with inexpensive gel colors. Lesson learned., I do like this but do not get to close to the sides of your nail. It will peel up. I can get it to last 7 to 10 days so I guess it's not to bad. Its not easy to take off unless it is peeling up. I am by no means a pro with my nails so it could totally be something that I am doing wrong but for the price it's not a bad product., Great quality for the price. Convenient that you don’t have to use rubbing alcohol after use. My nails stay on really well using the base and top coat. Used with uv light., look nice but the nail polish only last like 4 days., Liked this product and the cost is fair. I have used name brands that have cost more and this brand is equivalent., Bottles were broken at the cap. Bottles spilled out the contents. Was not able to be used. Very disappointed, This is my favorite base &amp; top coat set. I definitely wish that they made bigger bottles or maybe a refill bottle because I literally have to order a new set every week. I go through them too quickly and having the option to just refill my bottle would be so amazing., I really like this base/ top coat but it does leave almost a blue tint to the polish sometimes or it can be streaky., I am new to the DIY UV lamp. This is a must have for UV gel! Make sure your nails are clean and dry before you put the base coat (wiping with alcohol works well). Would recommend and buy again, Not a big fan of this. The base coat never dries (which I know is kind of okay cause it's a base coat) but overall it just takes forever under the lamp. And by that time things like dust get stuck in the polish so it's weird., Was old, Really smooth and shiny but it has a really strong smell, Bought for a friend and she said it's the best she's used this far. I'll stick to the Beetles brand but it's good to know there's an alternative that works well if necessary., good, This top coat sucks. It gets so cloudy and it doesn’t shine, I bought this as my first gel base and top coat. Polish lasted the average two week which was great. However, no matter how careful I applied it, it always left imperfections. Like it shrinks when it sets up under the light. Perfect and smooth going on. Ripples when dried. I tried it with many different colors/brands and always got the same result. I will stick to my new favorite CNC Shellac. Perfect every time, Used it twice. By the second time, the product had already become a useless gooey substance.Waste of money., I work whole day and full time mom and this works great lasts 10 days!, Easy to apply, Received today and not sure if this is oldProduct but I can’t get the top coat bottle open not sure but it’s definitely defective, You NEED the no wipe top for any of their polishes., I use plenty top coat but this is the worst by far, Works great., Pretty nice polish., After using this product as instructed I realized that the topcoat comes off way too easy. I am not happy with it. I do like the builder gel but other than that I do not like this product, My base coat takes a longer time to dry other than that will by again, Love the colors but peels off ez on natural nails, This set is really nice and works well for acrylic nails. Be warned that on natural nails the top coat burns when cured. Otherwise this product is awesome., Trash !!, I love the base and top coat the only problem I’ve had is that the top coat came really lumpy but I’ve been working through it and just wiping the clumps off as I work. But over all they’re both great and last., i love how it goes on----i got so excited i ordered more----but it chips after a few days---am so very disappointed in that---would not buy again----now that i already have!!!, bought it as a result of all them better tthan positive reviews, i was not at all disappointed! definitely recommended with no reservations!, Long lasting, but a few cons. The product is very runny so you have to be careful, otherwise you'll have a lot of clean up around your cuticles to do before curing. I didn't have issues with peeling or chipping until a couple weeks later, so that's a plus. The biggest con for me was the removal. I'm not sure this is really \"soak off\". I soak cotton balls in 100% pure acetone and wrap in foil. After 40 minutes, only the top coat budged.... A little. My gel polish, another brand, peeled off very easily, but underneath the base coat was hard as a rock. This is the same thing that happens when I use my regular gel polish top coat and forget that it has to filed off and accidentally soak them., I love a good base and top coat but I do not want it to be so thick. This product is much thicker than any I have used so far and I had a lot of bubbling on my nail and for these reasons I am passing on future purchases., I've been using these for years. Seems like the formula changed lately. Less shiny, doesn't have the same look under the LED light. Not sure how it will hold up., Top coat was clumpy. Purchased 2 x happened to both top coats, The top coat was not going on well.  I had to replace the top coat with a different brand but I still use the base coat, The base coat works quite well (difficult to remove it though), but after 1 or 2 uses the top coat doesn’t work very well at all. It bubbles like crazy leaving a polka dot texture,  and my nails start chipping after 4 or 5 days of wear. Would not recommend., Functionally decent. They smell atrocious though, more so than any nail product I've smelled in my life. Acrylic smells better than this stuff, it's like burning plastic straight from the bottle. Needs over 60 seconds under UV to set but that's not a huge deal., I don’t know what I’ve been doing wrong, if anything, but the base coat cures in a weird way. It will almost bubble and shrink to one side of my nail. I thought it was my technique or lamp, but I later found out it wasn’t the case. The top coat is pretty solid though, so I’ll keep using that., I was so excited about finding a cheaper alternative to the Sally Hansen brand - but the first time I stuck my hands in any water, the top coat chipped right off and looked awful. Also took a long time to cure., It's cheap, but you should probably just pay a bit more for a better top coat., Nice gel. As expected., Applies well, dries well with my lamp, is no wipe. My only complaint is that it doesn't get thick or strong enough., This product works for maybe a day or 2 but after that it peels off or chips easily. So with that being said it definitely easy to remove lol. Would recommend just spending the money on a better product that might cost more. You will save yourself time!, I've had these for some time now. I do prefer this formula over other brands, HOWEVER, after using for a while, the outside of the bottles gets extremely sticky. There is still plenty of polish left over in the bottle, so I hate to throw it away, but I might have to replace them because I can't stand the feeling. Other than that, everything is great. Just make sure that you keep them upright all the time and be careful when using., This is amazing product., Love this product works great cures in 30secs. Would recommend 2 anyone who wants stronger lasting 💅 nails, Polish started chipping on day 1. To be fair, it may have been the UV lamp I was using because I think it was defective; hence the extra 2 stars., I love that you don't have to wipe the topcoat, but no matter how long I soak my nails… The basecoat will not come off! I have excellent soak off fingernail  polish remover, But the basecoat will not come off  all of the way . I'm going to have to sand it off my nails., Wow! This stuff lasts a very long time, however it took me 3 separate times of soaking my nails with acetone to remove the top coat at 20 minutes each time. I buffed my nails first to scratch it too. It might be easier to let the polish grow out! The top coat polish keeps its shine for entire time. This stuff lasts a long time.The base coat didn't even come off, so I just buffed it off with my nail file.I want to give this a great review, the price is so good, it's just so darn hard to remove. I like the other polish colors, but just will use my other brand base and top coats instead., Polish was awful, it was thick and difficult to apply because it didn’t flow from the brush...it globbed. I did use the curing light-thinking it might kind of smooth out a bit??  and it took 4-5 mins  (supposed to take ONE minute!!)  to make it “seem” ok but it never did completely dry. HUGE waste of my money and my time, The top coat is amazing! I love it. The base coat is weird (minus a star).  You have to put a super EVEN coat on the whole nail and it can’t be too thin of a layer because it becomes uneven. You have to use just the right amount. Anyway, it makes me wonder if the base coat is even necessary. Also, the base coat doesn’t dry hard after the lamp. It’s a bit sticky so don’t touch it. That’s supposedly normal though., I have mixed feelings about this product. The first time I  used the polish it was amazing!! But the next time I used it it was like the top coat was setting/hardening on the brush. I pulled that clump off and then went on it worked just as the first time. But then when I go to use it the 3rd time there is little hard pieces all over the brush. The was no sticky film once you cure it under the light. I just wish I for more uses out of it rather than looking like 3... I've used many gel polishes but this is the first to do this. I may have gotten a bad batch or something. I really like the base coat I have had no problem with the my polish coming off of my nail., Sticky, very sticky, I don’t feel like it is quite as shiney  as previous ones I have purchased, Pretty good.  Once dry there are no problems with chipping or peeling.  But need to take extra time under the UV lamp.  I've used two different brand lamps and both take a while to dry.  So, be patient and you have a great polish., I've used several different base and top coats but when I used this one it started peeling off after 3 days. Nice shine but that's a bummer., Doesnt stay on., Really shiny, easy to use, but for some reasons, it turns yellow after a couple days (3-4)., I've been sandwhiching my my old polish with great success. Lasts over a week, I haven't waited for it to chip to remove.I don't notice any funky smell like other reviewers.I have to say though, the base coat is difficult to remove. I have to do a second round of buffing and soaking to get it off, and still have to buff of the remnants.PS. You have to let your nail polish dry before you put on the top coat or it will never dry!, Will buy again, Leaked everywhere. Such a mess. Had to throwaway., VERY disappointed in this product. I have used a better top and base coat in the past and repurchased those instead. I missed the cut off to return it, but I honestly would. It didn’t last more than a week!, This base coat was unbelievably bad.  It applied smoothly (to freshly washed &amp; cleaned nails that had been wiped clean of residue with alcohol), then as it cured it drew together into raised rivulets, leaving other parts of the nails completely bare. It also went spiky, with little points all over it that gave it a texture like there was sand mixed in. Needless to say, this did not provide a smooth canvas for my manicure, and when two coats of gel polish over it still couldn’t completely smooth it out, my only choice was to put a glitter overcoat over everything to camouflage it. So unimpressed!, Love ,love ,love. Very easy to apply and the topcoat is amazing. Week 3 and no chips on my nails. I have tried many other products,  but this is the BEST.  Highly recommend., TerribleQuality, make sure you are sober when you put it on the first. it's more difficult than regular polish, but it is 100% worth it,  very great colors and it last a lot longer., Base is not good. Top coat does cure pretty quickly but they really don't help the gel stay on longer as my gel chipped the next day. Was pretty annoyed at that., Good quality, very shiny but to little of product, I am glad I bought these but the top coat has been leaking a bit out of the top so it won’t last as long as I’d like but I still am pretty glad I bought it! And the price isn’t bad either!, I love this brand these are amazing, Unlike some name brand's, this product is too soft and allows your nails to tear. And peels off way too easy., It's ok I trying better that keep your nail polish on. More two day sad I have to do my nails very two days cause of product isn't good. Not worth the money., Excellent base &amp; top coat. Makes my nails really shiny and hard and my polish last for 2+ weeks. But it does seem to dent if you push your nail or something sharp into it and for that I’m removing one start. Removal is easy too with a 180 grit file., I gave it 2 star's because the base coat get hard at all so I order a different kind I hope it works better, Bad quality, I use gel polish that does not require a base coat, so I only use the top coat. It dries down nice and hard and does not have a sticky finish. My biggest complaint is that the top coat almost separates, and does not provide an even finish. Does the job, for the most part.</td>\n",
       "      <td>it is thick but works good once you get used to it these base and top coats work great for an at home gel manipedi my only issue was when i tried to soak and scrape it off it seemed like the base layer bonded almost too well with my nail and part of my nail layers scraped off i had to take a few months break between the next gel manicure because my nails were damaged this could just be user error or the fact that my nails are extremely thin they held up great though and looked beautiful the product works great the only reason i did not give five stars was because it smells terrible like a skunk almost and it is very strong but it works and works well i would buy it again beats having to use nail polish remover in the end best quality i have ever used at home nails come out looking professional very easy to use i recommend it smells awful while the polish is great every bottle i have ever had from them 4 all have leaked when on their side i love this product it is very easy and it last for 14 days best brand for top coat and base my favorite one terrible product the base coat seemed to work fine but the top coat was in such a gellike consistency that i could not even use it no matter how hard i shook the bottle up it remained the same waste of money only reason i gave it two stars instead of one is because the base coat worked all in all not happy the base coat is horrible you are better off just buying the top coat only top coat is average i would say i have done my manicures without the base and they come out better the base causes the polish to look bumpy really cool that i can do this at home just light and done my top coat bottle came completely empty i am returning for a replacement but it is disappointing poor quality was only good the first few uses base coat became thick and does not go on smoothly at all product quality changes over very short time would not recommend both me and my sister are allergic to this product after some use it causes nail bed pain and inflammation it is great that you take a picture but it helps if you show the door this was dropped off at 104 not 106 i could not get the base coat to dry fully i used my uv light 5 times 5 min and it was still tacky i gave up and went ahead and put polish over it anyway the polish i used thankfully was able to dry just fine the top coat seemed to dry much better but i will not be using this brand again overall this is a good set it can be thick so be sure to wipe the brush on the side of the bottle before applying and when covering your nail make sure to use thinner coats and apply evenly or else you will see the linesuneven levels after curingfor curing times i have a uv led lamp and was not sure how long to cure for top coat 60 seconds is perfect cures hard and comes off easily when time to remove for base coat i tried 60 seconds but was having a hard time when removing it so i went down to 30 seconds and that seems to have helped top coat dried out in the bottle after 3 uses returned perfect bottles came leaking from the top the gel polish i got to go along with these two bottles was perfectly fine and intact why these leaked i do not know i have not used them yet either since most of the product was all over the box it came in top coat goes on nicely and leaves a nice shinny coat and is not sticky pretty easy to come because the polish came off within a week i would have expected it to last at least 2 weeks very small but not too bad nice not that good this product worked amazingly well after a minute under led uv it was dry very sheer and worked well with my polygel kit first time trying this brand and my last very very thin like a refusal polish not hard at all nails broke easily i do not recommend this brand great product amazing lasts the longest out of anything i have tried this is a peel off formula i do follow all the instructions for application and i never use acetone to remove i soak in water for a few minutes or just hand wash some dishes and i am able to peel of the polish most times i one piece now while that its awesome because it removes easily the manicure does not last past 2 days with out major chipping i used it the first time and it worked real good but the second time was horrible i could not get it to set correctly it was in a way clumpy it sucks because i really wanted to like it horrible product does not stay on the top coat has a thick glue like consistency and does not spread on nail well peels off within a couple of days so disappointed is just a oil it is clumpy and did not even dry all the way through now my nails are smudgedestá muy gruesa y no se secaron bien mis youñas i ordered the base top coat about 4 years ago i loved it i started doing my own nails again so i wanted to try it againbad idea the base coat works fine but the top coat started clumping was too thick this was only the first use maybe they have changed the polish since the last time i used it but i will not be ordering it again works fine does not last too long though the base coat good but the top coat is trash starts peeling the next day great base and tip coat lasts atleast 3 weeks for me not even an ounce i have tried various steps in an effort to get this polish to last longer than 7 days it does not matter what i do it chips and looks like crap and has to be changed by day 7 i bought this base and top with amelie gel polish the topcoat got extremely clumpy after the second use causing an unsmooth finish i was super excited to get my gel polishes in with such fantastic ratings unfortunately the product was so thick when i went to apply it applied like a literal paste there is no good use for this polish and i would like a refund promptly i love the no wipe too coat saves me some time this brand does not hold up the shellac peels off a lot sooner then expected seriously soooo good i do my own gel nailstoes at home and this is by far the best set i have gotten gel polish is definitely an art and takes a long time to master if this set lifts you probably just are not doing your gel application correctly these two are excellent also added bonus you do not need to wipe the top coat the item itself is good but the bottles are very very tiny i wish they made them a little bigger for the price this does what it says it will do and the top coat is not sticky at all when it sets the only complaint i have is that if you try to close the bottle when there is polish on the brush and the polish gets onto the mouth of the bottle the cap will actually shrink wrap onto the mouth of the bottle making it very hard to open this has happened to me several times so now i make sure there is no polish on the outside of the mouth of the bottle and i try to close it very gently not tightly please be aware of how you close this nail polish otherwise it will take forever to open when you want to use it again i really loved this product for the first few months but recently began to have an allergic reaction to the product i am bummed i have to switch it up now because its great quality not saying do not buy it but definitely be mindful very good product will buy again applies and cures well but dulls your manicure significantly also the base coat is difficult to remove bought for my sister who does nails and she did not like it sadly i like the product it is a good shine and it lasts about two weeks i was pleased the gel has a murky purple coating during the day time it glows green under uv light when comparing this top coat to my kupa inc top coat there is a huge difference in color kupa inc top coat is clear and the aimeli has the murky purple coating so in love with this gel it is thick and gets into all the nooks and crannies it was actually recommended by a nail tech on you tube nailed by nikki and i had to try so far i am loving this product if you do not like thick gel this is not for you but trudt you will not regret this buy top coat does not wear well base coat works great dislike great base and top coat for gel nails not bad i have ordered it several times wish they would sell a matte top gel with these too i was scared at first because it was still tacky after curing under uv light but i read it is supposed to be so polish will stick continued with my nail routine and it turned out well really great product especially for the price great for beginners works well i brought the polish the size of the bottle for what you pay is pretty small i do not blink your eyes this chips and peels off about like regular nail polish it is nothing like gel nails that you get in the salon which is what i was looking for top coat turns yellow after a few days i have used the base and top coat 4 times so far and every time my nails start turning yellow after a few days i have tried different curing times and even wiped the top coat after but nothing seems to fix it this has never happened with other brands of gel top coat i have used worked pretty good good product for the price i usually get opi but this did the job this was great for the price only issue was it did chip in some nails but that may have been true to operator error i may not have cured the polish long enough all in all i am happy with my purchase also arrived a lot sooner than i had anticipated this i cannot even begin this is an amazing base and top coat my nails lasted it was easy to use and great for gelsi love it this is my first gel base and top coat so i really do not have anything to compare it to this must be a cheaper brand or the base coat is just bad i have been using file off gel polish and i was noticing that i have a problem not damaging my nail when filing it off it was not killing my nails but i figured soak off would case me to do less accidental damagei bought this brand because it was prime available and somewhat inexpensive in a week i have had two nails one on each hand peel completely off its not like the free edge got loose it just was really lifted in the middle or edge where it frowns in and the loose polish would get peeled up to an awkward place where i had to remove it or it would peel even more off the top layer of my nails one happened in just 3 days three days i fixed those two jankity nails and i also added a second coat of just the top coat to all of my nails after 1 week i cannot tell if the top coat is better or notnow this does have a perk its super easy to soak off and remove like wow it removes like butter but if its coming off super easy because it falls off of a well prepped nail in less than a week this is a problem i can now see why this has some lower ratings and why people would spend at least double on a widely known us name brand will i use the rest of teh bottle yes i am cheap i also like changing my nail polish color frequently if i can pull that off this soaks off so easy that i could totally change my polish all the time but it also just falls off which means when i am too busy to do a manicure once a week this just flat out sucksedit i have updated this review because after sitting and soaking off the polish i am really happy with how my nails look they are not damaged or sad looking it really did just bubble up and off this would not be my choice for wearing before going on vacation or trying to wear for weeks in a row since it does not bubble up and come off easily but if you like to change your nail color a couple of times a week you will be happy with this polish88 update i keep trying this basetop coat foolishly because i have it it keeps performing poorly polish just pops off within a day or two of application just spend more and get gelish even with shrinkage at least it stays on the nail better its my own fault for trying it again but good grief peels easy this basecoat is whack upon applying it it is separated like crazy when i applied my gel color over top it also would separate on top until the second or third layer when it evened out the topcoat is great not tacky once it is been cured and works as advertised top coat and base coat is very thick hard to apply thin took forever to cure and was sticky had to put under the led light a lot longer than suggested to cure and then my thumb completely peeled off this is the worst gel i have ever used does not really fully harden peels off not durable at all do not reccommend not good do not buy this this item is a great price for the two bottles and it a product that i like because of the no wipe top coat and it give a nice shiny finish easy to use and has a nice longevity impressed with the quality not so well i used this base and top coat with the gellen polish brand this stuff works great top coat is very glossy and dries fast with the uv lamp like instantly dry i have had these nails for 2 weeks and the gloss wore off a smidge but that is expected after 2 weeks still has not chipped or lost all glossiness i recommended this brand to 2 friends overall great purchase i will be buying the colors next i am reasonably new to gel nails and this was my first set of top and base which i bought as amazon reccommended it i am fully aware of how long it takes to remove gel but this stuff does not come off an hour of working at it every manicure with sandpaper bowls of acetone and wraps and it just does not budge yet it manages to lift along my cuticle line after a week and a half buy something higher quality and experiment with inexpensive gel colors lesson learned i do like this but do not get to close to the sides of your nail it will peel up i can get it to last 7 to 10 days so i guess it is not to bad its not easy to take off unless it is peeling up i am by no means a pro with my nails so it could totally be something that i am doing wrong but for the price it is not a bad product great quality for the price convenient that you do not have to use rubbing alcohol after use my nails stay on really well using the base and top coat used with uv light look nice but the nail polish only last like 4 days liked this product and the cost is fair i have used name brands that have cost more and this brand is equivalent bottles were broken at the cap bottles spilled out the contents was not able to be used very disappointed this is my favorite base top coat set i definitely wish that they made bigger bottles or maybe a refill bottle because i literally have to order a new set every week i go through them too quickly and having the option to just refill my bottle would be so amazing i really like this base top coat but it does leave almost a blue tint to the polish sometimes or it can be streaky i am new to the diy uv lamp this is a must have for uv gel make sure your nails are clean and dry before you put the base coat wiping with alcohol works well would recommend and buy again not a big fan of this the base coat never dries which i know is kind of okay because it is a base coat but overall it just takes forever under the lamp and by that time things like dust get stuck in the polish so it is weird was old really smooth and shiny but it has a really strong smell bought for a friend and she said it is the best she is used this far i will stick to the beetles brand but it is good to know there is an alternative that works well if necessary good this top coat sucks it gets so cloudy and it does not shine i bought this as my first gel base and top coat polish lasted the average two week which was great however no matter how careful i applied it it always left imperfections like it shrinks when it sets up under the light perfect and smooth going on ripples when dried i tried it with many different colorsbrands and always got the same result i will stick to my new favorite cnc shellac perfect every time used it twice by the second time the product had already become a useless gooey substancewaste of money i work whole day and full time mom and this works great lasts 10 days easy to apply received today and not sure if this is oldproduct but i cannot get the top coat bottle open not sure but it is definitely defective you need the no wipe top for any of their polishes i use plenty top coat but this is the worst by far works great pretty nice polish after using this product as instructed i realized that the topcoat comes off way too easy i am not happy with it i do like the builder gel but other than that i do not like this product my base coat takes a longer time to dry other than that will by again love the colors but peels off ez on natural nails this set is really nice and works well for acrylic nails be warned that on natural nails the top coat burns when cured otherwise this product is awesome trash i love the base and top coat the only problem i have had is that the top coat came really lumpy but i have been working through it and just wiping the clumps off as i work but over all they are both great and last i love how it goes oni got so excited i ordered morebut it chips after a few daysam so very disappointed in thatwould not buy againnow that i already have bought it as a result of all them better tthan positive reviews i was not at all disappointed definitely recommended with no reservations long lasting but a few cons the product is very runny so you have to be careful otherwise you will have a lot of clean up around your cuticles to do before curing i did not have issues with peeling or chipping until a couple weeks later so that is a plus the biggest con for me was the removal i am not sure this is really soak off i soak cotton balls in 100 pure acetone and wrap in foil after 40 minutes only the top coat budged a little my gel polish another brand peeled off very easily but underneath the base coat was hard as a rock this is the same thing that happens when i use my regular gel polish top coat and forget that it has to filed off and accidentally soak them i love a good base and top coat but i do not want it to be so thick this product is much thicker than any i have used so far and i had a lot of bubbling on my nail and for these reasons i am passing on future purchases i have been using these for years seems like the formula changed lately less shiny does not have the same look under the led light not sure how it will hold up top coat was clumpy purchased 2 x happened to both top coats the top coat was not going on well i had to replace the top coat with a different brand but i still use the base coat the base coat works quite well difficult to remove it though but after 1 or 2 uses the top coat does not work very well at all it bubbles like crazy leaving a polka dot texture and my nails start chipping after 4 or 5 days of wear would not recommend functionally decent they smell atrocious though more so than any nail product i have smelled in my life acrylic smells better than this stuff it is like burning plastic straight from the bottle needs over 60 seconds under uv to set but that is not a huge deal i do not know what i have been doing wrong if anything but the base coat cures in a weird way it will almost bubble and shrink to one side of my nail i thought it was my technique or lamp but i later found out it was not the case the top coat is pretty solid though so i will keep using that i was so excited about finding a cheaper alternative to the sally hansen brand but the first time i stuck my hands in any water the top coat chipped right off and looked awful also took a long time to cure it is cheap but you should probably just pay a bit more for a better top coat nice gel as expected applies well dries well with my lamp is no wipe my only complaint is that it does not get thick or strong enough this product works for maybe a day or 2 but after that it peels off or chips easily so with that being said it definitely easy to remove lol would recommend just spending the money on a better product that might cost more you will save yourself time i have had these for some

soft and allows your nails to tear and peels off way too easy it is ok i trying better that keep your nail polish on more two day sad i have to do my nails very two days because of product is not good not worth the money excellent base top coat makes my nails really shiny and hard and my polish last for 2 weeks but it does seem to dent if you push your nail or something sharp into it and for that i am removing one start removal is easy too with a 180 grit file i gave it 2 stars because the base coat get hard at all so i order a different kind i hope it works better bad quality i use gel polish that does not require a base coat so i only use the top coat it dries down nice and hard and does not have a sticky finish my biggest complaint is that the top coat almost separates and does not provide an even finish does the job for the most part</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was not impressed with the image quality.  Also the app that was suggested to use my phone as a remote for it did not work properly., Biggest pain to attach to a helmet. But works well otherwise., the only thing about the camera was that i had no clue it was so small., We enjoy using this camera to get a canine view of our dogs' activities! It fits well into their harness and we get to see them running, swimming, and playing. There are a large number of function and features, so reading the instructions is a must, especially to take full advantage of the power of this camera. It holds up well to use, we've had no problems with it in several months. Would definitely purchase again!, Not a good purchase, This camera works as advertised and video quality is more than I expected. Great features for the price. The adhesive in some of the mounts could be better. I wish they had special mount for ski helmets., This is a 12 megapixel camera with 4K video. Waterproof case is good and numerous attachments for mounts are included. Photo quality is less than average compared to my iPhone 6s and I can not get videos to play at all. Overall I would spend a few extra dollars and buy a better platform to capture life with., I bought this as a gift for my son, we haven't had a chance to use it just yet. The only issue I've had was inserting the SD memory card. Something seemed to be wrong with the slot. It wouldn't stay inserted all the way in, it seemed it was engaged like it already had a card in the slot. After some time I did manage to get it in correctly. We did do a practice video and took a picture, it has nice quality. We cant wait until the weather warms more to try it out., Bought this for my 9 year old son several months ago. It has been great. Glad we bought it. High quality for the reasonable price and a tough little camera.  It’s holding up well! No negatives I can think of. Works well with phone app. Glad I didn’t spend the extra money for GP. No need. This thing does it all. Lots of videos on YouTube comparing the two. See for yourself., Does not always stay on.I use it as a dash camera., The WIFI system sucks on this camera and the app it requires you to use keep crashing. I found another use for the camera but I would never by this camera again., I love this camera, works wonders for dirt bike trail riding and capturing sea life under water!, Product shipped fast, seems like a great camera so far just recently started using so not sure how to rate long term  yet., Audio doesn't pick up well in the protective case but the video is great. We're still learning to use it but the grandkids have fun recording things., I got this for my husband for a gift, the app didn't seem to work well with his Motorola phone, sinking issues and gave up on it. He has recently uodated to a new Samsung Galaxy 10, so hopefully will be able to get it to work w/it., Good price but takes terrible videos. It’s not worth the time to even save these videos. Look at the videos on the feedback, I don’t know why people think this is a good camera. Don’t waste your time., Very difficult to figure out what parts go to what and what they are used for. If you give them a good review they’ll give you another accessory that you’ll have no idea how to use. NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL INCLUDED. I guess you get what you pay for. I should have checked YouTube before purchasing this. Got it today, returning tomorrow., So far I'm impressed with this product. One things for sure no matter what u plan on mounting it to there's an accessory included to do so. I've only had it for a day but so far so good., doesn’t upload to your computer. Hard to work, This little cam is really good i went to the Bahamas last week and took many under water videos and photos and this camera work like a dream just remember to put in a high speed micro SD card (not included)., I absolutely love this and i have recommended it to all of my friends. I would definitely purchase this again. Thank you, No way that this is 12MP. No. Way! Also (and this was the main reason why I returned it)), the batteries lasted less than half an hour on a full charge. And, for some reason, the only way I could have turned on the camera was if I removed the battery from its compartment and re-insert it., Product works very well.  I use it for fishing and nature hikes. Taking videos hands free is a big advantage. I was impressed with all of the attachment accessories.Excellent value., While the picture is great, it appears that you have to set the date and time every time you change the battery. I haven't found anything in the manual that will save the date and time permanently which is unacceptable. Well I just found it #11. It says \"if you replace the battery, date and time will reset\". WT???????, Disappointing didn’t even work for 30mins in the water and stop working. Don’t waste your money!!!, UPDATED review:(SUPPORT to the Win) After seeing this review, the manufacturer emailed me back, and sent me 2 new batteries no charge, and both were timed by filming a clock, (lol) and both did about 2hrs of run time, of course i ran this once on each. Once summer comes i will pull out the helmet cam and go riding and push the camera to the limit. Advice, be sure to keep the camera outside of the waterpoof case if your riding in the heat, it gets hot with those batteries. Thanks Akaso for the follow upOriginal Review:I purchased this for my mtn bike rides and well it works nice but if you like having to try and time yourself on the trail and at 20 min per battery and only have 2 batteries than well, go for it, its a nice toy. Otherwise ya pay for what you get., The quality of the camera is about what you would expect for $60. It works exceptionally well in brightly lit areas like the outdoors and it also has a wide variety of attachments that make it great for whatever activity you plan on documenting such as hiking, water sports or skating.It's a great entry camera for people who are interested in getting involved with filmography., So I bought this item last year for a Xmas gift, and we are now just being able to use it. And the cord doesn't charge the battery, Works great for its price as well as wrist watch works with Simonides cameras as well great product great battery life, Lots of ways to use this camera. Ordered this thinking it would b great to b able to video our hunting dogs.  We were surprise at all the features it offered.  Must download the instructions and read carefully in order to get the best use from camera., Gave to grandchild.  Loves to show what he does., Wouldn't work for half my trip bought a memory card for it that was ment for the device, kept saying card in valid,battery's lasted about an 1hr, Have not had a chance to give a performance test of it. The box ship in was way to small for the item and it could have (lucky it did not) get damaged. So right now only can say packaging was not good. Will see later this week if camera is any good., It seems like a good camera. I have only used it in the pool so far.  I won't do scuba diving with it until June.The instructins are VERY lacking so it makes it much harder to figure out how to use.Also, I thought it had WAY to many extra parts that I will NEVER use., Very very, complicated. It will take a while to figure out., After opening the box and trying to figure it all out with no so hot directions and diagrams, I gave up and gave it to a friend's son who has more experience with the tech.  So many pieces and it was just not worth it for me.  I never even got it working so I can't judge the camera at all.  So, if you are into high tech camera stuff, it might be great, average user, not so much., It's not a bad unit if you're not willing to spend the money on the higher quality cameras. Bought it for hunting but it's hard to use in a pinch., No comparison to the GoPro.Not many features. No zooming capabilities. I guess you get what you pay for.Update: since posting the above I was contacted by Akaso and offered a partial refund which I received immediately once I agreed to it. Very good customer service., Camera shoots video really well for the price, however the app that goes with it is garbage, This is a good value camera we use for family events. Great price for an action cam, It's a solid camera pictures are ok. But, they look better on my phone. The batteries die pretty quick, I bought this as a second action cam to use for a different angle. The reviews I saw made it look impressive. My main camera is a Gopro Hero 4 so the video and audio quality just doesn't compare. If you were using 2 or 3 of these you could get by ok but this one just can't begin to keep up. It's kinda like a Volkswagen and a Ferrari having a race.One handy item with it that I didn't think I would use in the remote control. For videos, I just don't see much use but for snapping a picture it does \"ok\"., Not what I expected., Did not like that it was not compatible with my laptop or my android phone.  I needed a Mac computer or video editor to down load my videos., Fell off my motorcycle and broke and pieces first time out never got to use it, This product never worked. I took two videos and then it stopped turning on. Being the only camera I took on my trip to Egypt, I was very dissapointed., Takes amazing still shots at 60 fps while traveling at 55+ mph. Do not buy this if you are mounting it to anything that goes down the road. Instead spend a few dollars more and get the Brave 4 which is the upgrade to this model, which includes image stabilization. I can't report yet on how good that feature is on the other camera having bought it to replace this one. However, this one creates unwatchable video, at least mounted to a motorcycle. The image shudder is horrendous. You see some four different layers of the horizon jumbled together when playing back the video on the computer.  On this lower model the remote required the camera to be active for the two buttons to work. They do not turn the camera on. They don't stay lit as an indicator. On the back the lcd is nice, but to determine which mode is active, you have to look closely for the white camera icon to go red, when recording. When taking a snapshot, the screen flickers and resets to the camera, non recording mode. I used this flickering  indicator to know if the camera was recording, while looking through a tinted windshield where its mounted on the front of my bike.The upper model seems to have addressed some of these concerns, for the better. I'll have to review it once i get out on the bike and test it. There is yet another model that is even higher priced than the Brave 4, that one s You tuber claimed had real 4k and not digitally processed 4k like these two lower models, if that's a concern. I had no complaint with the still frame on this camera at speed, set to 60fps, even if it is not true 4k., This arrived with the plastic part that holds the camera to the handle broken.  It worked for the first couple of days, then the charging became iffy to the point where I had to hold the cable titled for it to charge. Then the next day the USB port fell inward into the unit and it could no longer charge.  The failure of the USB port after only a couple uses indicates that the manufacturing of this product is inferior. The camera was returned., Used it 4 times and now it doesn't work. I hope the added warranty is better than the camera., I bought this camera to help record a ski trip with my kids.  The biggest negative I have for it is that the camera is not waterproof.  I couldn't get any audio with the camera because it was stuck inside a waterproof case the whole time.  The worst part is the case got scratched on the lense so now I cant use the case and cant seem to find a replacement., DONT DO IT!!! My husband and I got this for our cruise and the SD card wouldn’t go in the camera. It’s like a piece was blocking it from going in so we couldn’t use it at all. Tried to get in contact and nothing. Spend the extra money for name brand of this is what off brand is like., I appreciate the quality of this product, Just received this yesterday. I have downloaded to apps in order to get videos. One says it download once you go to it you can only hear it. The other one let's you download it but can't share it anywhere because it's only the sound as well. You need a better app for people who only have phones to use. I'm going to try a couple more things but so far not really that great because of the app. If someone could let me know what they use for their phone that would be great. Thanks, Positive: product is cheap compare with others in the market. Image and video quality are okay.Negative: wifi features along with app connectivity are bad. Disconnects for no reason and is hard to manage. Sometime it will disconnect from the app but you couldn't work with it manually, unless you give it a hard reset (disconnect the battery). If you want better quality and connection I suggest you go with a GoPro., This item have been open before arriving to me . It box was without its brand new warranty seal, it is very shame why is happening it ? . It is lack of respect to the costumer;  please., Very poor quality overall. Picture, sound, stabilization are all not very good. After reading the other reviews that were positive, I don’t know if I even had the sam camera. Used it for a few hours and tried to be positive. After that, I returned it and got a Go Pro and I am so much happier., This camera came with so many amazing features and accessories! I love how great the underwater camera quality is and that it comes with two rechargeable batteries instead of constantly buying new batteries. It's super easy to use; my 4-year old can even operate it in the pool. Definitely recommend., My wife and I really liked it. For this price to be able to get a solid camera was really clutch! We went on a trip to DR and used it for a variety of adventures and I’m no camera guru at all. Can’t wait to try it for extreme uses., Used camera in and out of water works great the handle on camera needs to be longer to help stabilize the camera shot, Use this for my motorcycle. It does the job for cheap if you're looking for an action cam. 1 thing I would advise is to stock up on extra batteries. My daily commute is approximately 20 minutes and when I arrive, battery is near empty already. Maybe it's my settings(?) Not bad, just expecting a bit more., It works great! Sound is quiet if not connected to the iSmart dv app., Battery life last less than 90 minutes. Screen turns black when you are recording, so you can't see what you are filming. I wouldn't recommend it. I thought it was good at first but for longevity it isn't worth it. If you only plan to do 30 minutes between charges then it is right for you., I'm very happy with this camera. It comes with two rechargeable batteries, several mounts and a water-proof case for underwater footage., I picked this up for an up and coming trip as my primary camera failed after about 17 years (canon). I realize this isnt expected to perform on still photos as well as an SLR but i figured it would do as well as my cheap phone. It doesnt. Still photos are blurred no matter how they are taken. If you use them for thumbnails they are fine but if you plan to take stills of your trips do NOT use this as you will be very disappointed. The remote works. The \"water proof\" case is more like water resistant on the low end. Drop it in the tub its not going to protect your camera in my testing. Also the accessories everyone raves about. Almost all of them are useless outside buying more parts. They have a pamphlet that comes with the device you have to register to get the \"good stuff\". I refuse to do this because it means more spam. It borders on misleading. Anyhow, good low end, cheap and second camera ok for primary \"action\" video but nothing to write home about., good camera for price  def worth it just wish batterys lasted longer, OK here's my review I've loved the camera for since I purchased it and have taken many beautiful videos however, I just discovered that there's really no way of editing it I'm not sure why that is I expected it to be just as easy to edit it as a go pro but it's not.  So if you wanna just look at the videos that you shoot without editing  them it's a good camera takes great pictures but for me without the ability to edit it's basically worthless. I downloaded about 6 different editing software apps on my phone and none of them will recognize the video file.  It would be nice if the company that makes these cameras addressed this issue., - Price is awesome! Won't give me a heart-attack in case I lost it while having outdoor activities.- Camera is small and light enough to be attached to wrist- Camera is water-proof and operates well in water- Images and videos are stable and good quality for this price- It served us well in a recent rafting trip to Yellowstone and more ski trips in the winter., The camara stop recording for not reason and When it was recording you can not watch all the videos. Only a few. And the others video shows error, My son and I started using the AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports Action Camera Ultra HD Waterproof DV Camcorder 12MP 170 Degree Wide Angle yesterday and he had an absolute blast with it. Picture quality was great!  Unfortunately, as we were charging it this morning, the charging port pushed directly into the camera and was shaking around inside! We were able to unscrew the front of the camera and remove the charging port. It looks like it was only attached with two small tack welds. I emailed the company (through Amazon), but Amazon responded that there is an issue with the email address the company provided.  I didn't expect this camera to last forever, but I did expect the charging port to last more than 24 hours!, The camera has one of the worst picture and sound quality I've seen., Our gopro got water in it and ruined, so we wanted a replacement without spending so much money. This is the same size as a gopro...pretty good quality video. It came with 2 rechargeable batteries.  We also got the accessories which are a good cost and have so many options. If you do not want to spend a lot of money this is a great option for you!, It’s works great. My only problem with it is that I was recording a thing for my school and it would suddenly freeze and the only way to fix it was  to take out the battery. Apon further inspection, it would freeze whenever shaken too harshly., Finally got to use my camera on a scuba dive. But didn't really use it cause it leaked and is now not in my return window! Super disappointed!, This camera has ok image quality. It has a short battery life when recording, only about 1 hour. It does not come with a memory card.Rated 3 stars because of the short recording time/ battery life., Image quality for the money was good. Image stabilization not good. Good camera for the money, This camera ruined my motorcycle trip to morocco.  I was hopeing to get some footage of my motorcycle trip.  This camera would not work for me.  It continually froze and would become unresponsive after less than 5 minutes of operation., Nice little action cam for the price. Takes good video. Sound is not the best., Really really poor camera and sound quality. Waste of money to be honest. Bought to record vacation memories and aircraft takeoffs and landings. The sound quality is the worst., The video quality is just ok. This is a case where you see 4K and think its gonna be great, then you get it and its just OK., It is a small camera and I like that. I can take it with me wherever I go if I need it. I like the battery. And is easy to take pictures and video but I don't like too much the picture quality and color balance. All depends how you want to use it., Unfortunately I haven't been able to use this camera but twice. The battery says charged but when I unplug from the power source it shuts off. The buttons are confusing. Manual was no help. I was really excited to get and use this camera for my horse back riding but guess I will look for something else., This is a great alternative to trendy GoPro cameras. It has all the features the kids are looking for for sport videos and more., Good amount of accessories and quality seems as good as the GoPro., Not a bad camera just not was i was expecting. Having a GoPro this doesn’t really compare., After 3 weeks it stopped working.  I returned it for a full refund and got myself a GoPro Hero 5.  It is working well, and longer than this camera.  I would have kept it, had it continued to work., I actually bought 2. I'm changing my original 4 stars to just 2. The quality of the videos I shot and downloaded are very poor. Not the quality of my work! But from the camera. From both cameras. When I first noticed I went and shot with the other camera. Same thing! It's very disappointing., You get what you pay for.... video is extremely jumpy. Picture doesn’t even seem to be 720p., If you want to record your bike rides, this camera is NOT a good choice. It doesn’t have any image stabilization., Image is not clear, not 4K, This camera is easy to use and takes really good clear pictures. I've used this during hunts and for other random things. Great camera., Before I could use it for the third time. The clip that holds the buttons in place. The one for the power. Came off!! No it's useless under water or in salt air conditions!! Not happy at all!!! It was a week old at best!!, A little shakey when running but overall it's a nice camera for the price, Great videos, but the battery life is goes quickly., The battery didn't last very long - a couple hours at most.  The plus side is the camera comes with two rechargeable batteries so I was able to replace it when it died.  Video quality was good, picture quality left much to be desired.  I could've taken better pictures on my phone.  Sound is almost non-existent when in the water proof case.  It comes with many accessories that I couldn't figure out and the manual was no help.  Tons of accessories but not one selfie stick which is really what we wanted.  I bought this for a trip to Kauai and it served its purpose.  If you're looking for an affordable option for a vacation I recommend buying this camera.  If you're looking to get more usage than one trip, I'd recommend investing in a better camera., Great Color. But battery only lasts about 30 minutes., Quality seems very solid, has gone on a few kayaking trips so far and the waterproofing is up to the job.  Video quality is really good although I'll admit I haven't spent any time testing its limits as far as fast action or low light conditions.  I'll probably buy a few more, I have a Gen 1 Gopro Hero and this easily meets the same quality plus more features., Just check the video for yourself! This is a recording of the Audio/Video Sync Test available on YouTube that I recorded just minutes ago. I have emailed Akaso support. I'll provide an update once I hear back., The charging port no longer works, seems the fins in the actual port bent over?, Great value on the dollar., Got this for a trip to the USVI and got some great moments with it, This does not include a needed micro card., I purchased this item thinking it would be a bargain deal that's comparable to GoPro. They're incomparable and I wished I would've spent a little extra for a much better quality GoPro., Like how portable it is yet provides great quality videos, Great for the price. However, it only takes good video and pictures in high light. Low light settings look terrible. Definitely not 1080 p., Video quality is very poor. Cannot be use for anything proper. Phone take a better video, Just bought this for my daughter’s birthday. She will be using this on our vacation this summer!, I bought this camera as a good alternative to the name brand rival that is 5 times the cost, figured what do I have to lose, it’s only $75. I was actually pleasantly suprised that the video quality above and under water is really good. Then I downloaded the software from the app store and was wondering why it has so many bad reviews and barely a 2 star rating. After installing it I attempted to transfer some of my videos from the camera to my phone and the app would crash on any video that is longer then 1 minute in length. Also the downloaded videos remain with in the app and can’t be saved to your stream. In conclusion the iphone app is very poor quality and if you don’t mind removing the SD card to copy the video to your computer then this camera is a good buy, otherwise if you want to use the app on your phone and to transfer the video footage to your phone over wifi I would not recommend this camera or this brand, Image quality and stabilization is bad. Returning the product., Doesn't work properly as expected some time it turns on some time it doesn't battery were fully charge this item sucks, Really easy set up, Works Great!, I used it in my car to capture the back roads and the battery life is a lot shorter than another action camera.  Used it once ride and returned it just because of battery life., Nice action cam but they could do better no stabilization at all, No instructions included but did come with a good bit of attachments, It’s okay... I bought a memory card. When I video the screen blacks out after a min. There were bubbles on the screen when I opened it., I liked the camera and had good picture., Unfortunately the cover of my battery broke and now I can’t used, I wish they would include in the description somewhere that this camera does NOT include audio! Only photo/video. Waste of money for me.</td>\n",

unit if you are not willing to spend the money on the higher quality cameras bought it for hunting but it is hard to use in a pinch no comparison to the gopronot many features no zooming capabilities i guess you get what you pay forupdate since posting the above i was contacted by akaso and offered a partial refund which i received immediately once i agreed to it very good customer service camera shoots video really well for the price however the app that goes with it is garbage this is a good value camera we use for family events great price for an action cam it is a solid camera pictures are ok but they look better on my phone the batteries die pretty quick i bought this as a second action cam to use for a different angle the reviews i saw made it look impressive my main camera is a gopro hero 4 so the video and audio quality just does not compare if you were using 2 or 3 of these you could get by ok but this one just cannot begin to keep up it is kind of like a volkswagen and a ferrari having a raceone handy item with it that i did not think i would use in the remote control for videos i just do not see much use but for snapping a picture it does ok not what i expected did not like that it was not compatible with my laptop or my android phone i needed a mac computer or video editor to down load my videos fell off my motorcycle and broke and pieces first time out never got to use it this product never worked i took two videos and then it stopped turning on being the only camera i took on my trip to egypt i was very dissapointed takes amazing still shots at 60 fps while traveling at 55 mph do not buy this if you are mounting it to anything that goes down the road instead spend a few dollars more and get the brave 4 which is the upgrade to this model which includes image stabilization i cannot report yet on how good that feature is on the other camera having bought it to replace this one however this one creates unwatchable video at least mounted to a motorcycle the image shudder is horrendous you see some four different layers of the horizon jumbled together when playing back the video on the computer on this lower model the remote required the camera to be active for the two buttons to work they do not turn the camera on they do not stay lit as an indicator on the back the lcd is nice but to determine which mode is active you have to look closely for the white camera icon to go red when recording when taking a snapshot the screen flickers and resets to the camera non recording mode i used this flickering indicator to know if the camera was recording while looking through a tinted windshield where its mounted on the front of my bikethe upper model seems to have addressed some of these concerns for the better i will have to review it once i get out on the bike and test it there is yet another model that is even higher priced than the brave 4 that one s you tuber claimed had real 4k and not digitally processed 4k like these two lower models if that is a concern i had no complaint with the still frame on this camera at speed set to 60fps even if it is not true 4k this arrived with the plastic part that holds the camera to the handle broken it worked for the first couple of days then the charging became iffy to the point where i had to hold the cable titled for it to charge then the next day the usb port fell inward into the unit and it could no longer charge the failure of the usb port after only a couple uses indicates that the manufacturing of this product is inferior the camera was returned used it 4 times and now it does not work i hope the added warranty is better than the camera i bought this camera to help record a ski trip with my kids the biggest negative i have for it is that the camera is not waterproof i could not get any audio with the camera because it was stuck inside a waterproof case the whole time the worst part is the case got scratched on the lense so now i cannot use the case and cannot seem to find a replacement do not do it my husband and i got this for our cruise and the sd card would not go in the camera it is like a piece was blocking it from going in so we could not use it at all tried to get in contact and nothing spend the extra money for name brand of this is what off brand is like i appreciate the quality of this product just received this yesterday i have downloaded to apps in order to get videos one says it download once you go to it you can only hear it the other one let us you download it but cannot share it anywhere because it is only the sound as well you need a better app for people who only have phones to use i am going to try a couple more things but so far not really that great because of the app if someone could let me know what they use for their phone that would be great thanks positive product is cheap compare with others in the market image and video quality are okaynegative wifi features along with app connectivity are bad disconnects for no reason and is hard to manage sometime it will disconnect from the app but you could not work with it manually unless you give it a hard reset disconnect the battery if you want better quality and connection i suggest you go with a gopro this item have been open before arriving to me it box was without its brand new warranty seal it is very shame why is happening it it is lack of respect to the costumer please very poor quality overall picture sound stabilization are all not very good after reading the other reviews that were positive i do not know if i even had the sam camera used it for a few hours and tried to be positive after that i returned it and got a go pro and i am so much happier this camera came with so many amazing features and accessories i love how great the underwater camera quality is and that it comes with two rechargeable batteries instead of constantly buying new batteries it is super easy to use my 4year old can even operate it in the pool definitely recommend my wife and i really liked it for this price to be able to get a solid camera was really clutch we went on a trip to dr and used it for a variety of adventures and i am no camera guru at all cannot wait to try it for extreme uses used camera in and out of water works great the handle on camera needs to be longer to help stabilize the camera shot use this for my motorcycle it does the job for cheap if you are looking for an action cam 1 thing i would advise is to stock up on extra batteries my daily commute is approximately 20 minutes and when i arrive battery is near empty already maybe it is my settings not bad just expecting a bit more it works great sound is quiet if not connected to the ismart dv app battery life last less than 90 minutes screen turns black when you are recording so you cannot see what you are filming i would not recommend it i thought it was good at first but for longevity it is not worth it if you only plan to do 30 minutes between charges then it is right for you i am very happy with this camera it comes with two rechargeable batteries several mounts and a waterproof case for underwater footage i picked this up for an up and coming trip as my primary camera failed after about 17 years canon i realize this is not expected to perform on still photos as well as an slr but i figured it would do as well as my cheap phone it does not still photos are blurred no matter how they are taken if you use them for thumbnails they are fine but if you plan to take stills of your trips do not use this as you will be very disappointed the remote works the water proof case is more like water resistant on the low end drop it in the tub its not going to protect your camera in my testing also the accessories everyone raves about almost all of them are useless outside buying more parts they have a pamphlet that comes with the device you have to register to get the good stuff i refuse to do this because it means more spam it borders on misleading anyhow good low end cheap and second camera ok for primary action video but nothing to write home about good camera for price def worth it just wish batterys lasted longer ok here is my review i have loved the camera for since i purchased it and have taken many beautiful videos however i just discovered that there is really no way of editing it i am not sure why that is i expected it to be just as easy to edit it as a go pro but it is not so if you want to just look at the videos that you shoot without editing them it is a good camera takes great pictures but for me without the ability to edit it is basically worthless i downloaded about 6 different editing software apps on my phone and none of them will recognize the video file it would be nice if the company that makes these cameras addressed this issue price is awesome will not give me a heartattack in case i lost it while having outdoor activities camera is small and light enough to be attached to wrist camera is waterproof and operates well in water images and videos are stable and good quality for this price it served us well in a recent rafting trip to yellowstone and more ski trips in the winter the camara stop recording for not reason and when it was recording you can not watch all the videos only a few and the others video shows error my son and i started using the akaso ek7000 4k wifi sports action camera ultra hd waterproof dv camcorder 12mp 170 degree wide angle yesterday and he had an absolute blast with it picture quality was great unfortunately as we were charging it this morning the charging port pushed directly into the camera and was shaking around inside we were able to unscrew the front of the camera and remove the charging port it looks like it was only attached with two small tack welds i emailed the company through amazon but amazon responded that there is an issue with the email address the company provided i did not expect this camera to last forever but i did expect the charging port to last more than 24 hours the camera has one of the worst picture and sound quality i have seen our gopro got water in it and ruined so we wanted a replacement without spending so much money this is the same size as a gopropretty good quality video it came with 2 rechargeable batteries we also got the accessories which are a good cost and have so many options if you do not want to spend a lot of money this is a great option for you it is works great my only problem with it is that i was recording a thing for my school and it would suddenly freeze and the only way to fix it was to take out the battery apon further inspection it would freeze whenever shaken too harshly finally got to use my camera on a scuba dive but did not really use it because it leaked and is now not in my return window super disappointed this camera has ok image quality it has a short battery life when recording only about 1 hour it does not come with a memory cardrated 3 stars because of the short recording time battery life image quality for the money was good image stabilization not good good camera for the money this camera ruined my motorcycle trip to morocco i was hopeing to get some footage of my motorcycle trip this camera would not work for me it continually froze and would become unresponsive after less than 5 minutes of operation nice little action cam for the price takes good video sound is not the best really really poor camera and sound quality waste of money to be honest bought to record vacation memories and aircraft takeoffs and landings the sound quality is the worst the video quality is just ok this is a case where you see 4k and think its going to be great then you get it and its just ok it is a small camera and i like that i can take it with me wherever i go if i need it i like the battery and is easy to take pictures and video but i do not like too much the picture quality and color balance all depends how you want to use it unfortunately i have not been able to use this camera but twice the battery says charged but when i unplug from the power source it shuts off the buttons are confusing manual was no help i was really excited to get and use this camera for my horse back riding but guess i will look for something else this is a great alternative to trendy gopro cameras it has all the features the kids are looking for for sport videos and more good amount of accessories and quality seems as good as the gopro not a bad camera just not was i was expecting having a gopro this does not really compare after 3 weeks it stopped working i returned it for a full refund and got myself a gopro hero 5 it is working well and longer than this camera i would have kept it had it continued to work i actually bought 2 i am changing my original 4 stars to just 2 the quality of the videos i shot and downloaded are very poor not the quality of my work but from the camera from both cameras when i first noticed i went and shot with the other camera same thing it is very disappointing you get what you pay for video is extremely jumpy picture does not even seem to be 720p if you want to record your bike rides this camera is not a good choice it does not have any image stabilization image is not clear not 4k this camera is easy to use and takes really good clear pictures i have used this during hunts and for other random things great camera before i could use it for the third time the clip that holds the buttons in place the one for the power came off no it is useless under water or in salt air conditions not happy at all it was a week old at best a little shakey when running but overall it is a nice camera for the price great videos but the battery life is goes quickly the battery did not last very long a couple hours at most the plus side is the camera comes with two rechargeable batteries so i was able to replace it when it died video quality was good picture quality left much to be desired i could have taken better pictures on my phone sound is almost nonexistent when in the water proof case it comes with many accessories that i could not figure out and the manual was no help tons of accessories but not one selfie stick which is really what we wanted i bought this for a trip to kauai and it served its purpose if you are looking for an affordable option for a vacation i recommend buying this camera if you are looking to get more usage than one trip i would recommend investing in a better camera great color but battery only lasts about 30 minutes quality seems very solid has gone on a few kayaking trips so far and the waterproofing is up to the job video quality is really good although i will admit i have not spent any time testing its limits as far as fast action or low light conditions i will probably buy a few more i have a gen 1 gopro hero and this easily meets the same quality plus more features just check the video for yourself this is a recording of the audiovideo sync test available on youtube that i recorded just minutes ago i have emailed akaso support i will provide an update once i hear back the charging port no longer works seems the fins in the actual port bent over great value on the dollar got this for a trip to the usvi and got some great moments with it this does not include a needed micro card i purchased this item thinking it would be a bargain deal that is comparable to gopro they are incomparable and i wished i would have spent a little extra for a much better quality gopro like how portable it is yet provides great quality videos great for the price however it only takes good video and pictures in high light low light settings look terrible definitely not 1080 p video quality is very poor cannot be use for anything proper phone take a better video just bought this for my daughters birthday she will be using this on our vacation this summer i bought this camera as a good alternative to the name brand rival that is 5 times the cost figured what do i have to lose it is only 75 i was actually pleasantly suprised that the video quality above and under water is really good then i downloaded the software from the app store and was wondering why it has so many bad reviews and barely a 2 star rating after installing it i attempted to transfer some of my videos from the camera to my phone and the app would crash on any video that is longer then 1 minute in length also the downloaded videos remain with in the app and cannot be saved to your stream in conclusion the iphone app is very poor quality and if you do not mind removing the sd card to copy the video to your computer then this camera is a good buy otherwise if you want to use the app on your phone and to transfer the video footage to your phone over wifi i would not recommend this camera or this brand image quality and stabilization is bad returning the product does not work properly as expected some time it turns on some time it does not battery were fully charge this item sucks really easy set up works great i used it in my car to capture the back roads and the battery life is a lot shorter than another action camera used it once ride and returned it just because of battery life nice action cam but they could do better no stabilization at all no instructions included but did come with a good bit of attachments it is okay i bought a memory card when i video the screen blacks out after a min there were bubbles on the screen when i opened it i liked the camera and had good picture unfortunately the cover of my battery broke and now i cannot used i wish they would include in the description somewhere that this camera does not include audio only photovideo waste of money for me</td>\n",

       "      <td>The laptop arrived just in time for school!! Works great., Product description very much lied about the keyboard being backlit. Pretty pissed about that considering it the reason I chose this laptop over others I was looking at. Otherwise, it works fine for the basic little wprd processor I use it for. Also, not a cool design like any online description of the model. This one is straight flat black. Incredibly plain-looking. And one of my keys is at a wonky angle, but it works. Considering the ither asus products I own, this one falls short, honestly.If you want to take it out of S Mode, go to activation and choose to change your edition to regular Windows Home. Its a free switch., Works good.But the keyboard is not backlit.Good buy, if you don't need a backlit keyboard., I love how light weight and compact it is. And the numeric pad as well. So far I’m pretty happy and content with it., I ordered this small laptop for work purposes and general office operations.  So far, it's been well worth the money.  I took it out of Windows S mode.  It struggled (lagged) a bit with Chrome, so I resorted to using the Microsoft Internet browser but it's been fine.  And since I only use it for work (general office stuff), it's done everything that I could have asked....thus far!, The number dial is pretty accurate. Sleek design and very lightweight. Perfect product for the average commuter, If you feel that you need the trifling advantage of the \"easy access\" NumberPad, go ahead and buy this one. If you don't, avoid this one--it's a constant annoyance. Think you can permanently disable the NumberPad? Good luck with that., Amazing product it’s small do you can easily carry it around with no extra weight, For 190 bucks, this is perfect. I think tablets are very overrated.  I only like touchscreens on a phone.  This computer is the size of a tablet, incredibly light.  I just wanted something to do my financial stuff, email, shop and casually browse the internet.  I don't watch movies on my computer but it plays you tube type videos just fine.  sound is a little weak but if I want to listen to music I can cast it to my stereo.  What I like best is the size and weight. Small and light. And it seems to be built solid. I charge it at night and use it off and on all day and there is plenty of juice left. I could probably charge it every other night if I wanted.  I've only had it a couple weeks but I feel very good about my purchase., Screen was good but touch screen sucked...the lol mouse would disappear from screen and just pop up anywhere and wouldnt click on items the 1st click(it takes multiple clicks to get to where I'm trying to go)., It is perfect for my personal use and easy to navigate. Light weight and fits into my bag to carry with me., I like the size and for the price it’s worth buying., small, compact and convenient, Stay away from Windows 10 S ! Let me tell you what it is ..... trash 🗑!!!!!!! You can’t download anything from browser unless is from their crappy App Store! I couldn’t download Sketchup ! This is the worst part you CANT use GOOGLE!!! Like what the F ! They only allow you to use Bing ,who in the right mind uses that search engine!! No oneeee! You have to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to Windows 10 pro to be able to use your brand new computer like a normal person would like to do! Very very disappointed with this stupid “windows 10s” upgrade! (Not even an upgrade)!!!!! Please do your self a favor and buy a Mac !, My wife bought this for email and Facebook essentially. I had to uninstall the Windows 10S features because it kept freezing on the screen that said only approved windows 10 S apps would work.This warning came up randomly even though the only apps on the laptop WERE from the Microsoft App store.Finally I said ok no more Windows 10S and dropped it in favor of plain Windows 10. Since that time there has been no problem and no discernible detriment to the function. It is very small so be advised if this is a concern., ********************************** 07/24/2021 **********************************being firmilier with windows seizing possession of computers overclocking chip-sets and burning them out first on my listidisabled secure boot and set the supervisor password in bios so windows andits automatic this and automatic that could not inflict further damage to thehardware without firstly obtaining my express permissionnot trusting windows and its most advanced network hacking teqnikesi then proceeded to install my 9 GB linux clone in 10 minutes flathowever i needed windows to register this new computer sos i started windowsafter setup finished without a internet connection it said theres nointernet conection try this troubleshooterwhich arived at the decision that i needed to reset the router (NOT TRUE)  duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhbut why win 10 was updating at chip sizlun full throttle thats the true reason  out of pure curiosity i let this rogue os update it took a full day and a halfbefore i could use edge browser to register in my asusand by the way my last laptop used to do the same thing everytime itupdated until i**************************************************************** disabled the automatic updates  ** by setting the ipv4 gateway address to a bad address ** and unchecking ipv6 protocal  ** in the network configuration dialogue  ****************************************************************2 words braught the micysoft madness to a sqeeky halt********  GRUB-INSTALL *********the wifi chip is a realtekRTL8821CE---the cpu temp is a cool 100 degree farenhite after waking from a nap---and under your control linux will run your chipset at 108 degrees farenheightat idle with bluetooth radio on---in linuxvbox windows 98 running the yamaha SYXG50 soft synthysizer which by the wayrenders the dsp effects in software on 12 miditracks laden with yamaha sysex register 20% cpu utilizationand 117 degree farenheit cpu temp and play hifi music without hickupthis vm cuts the battery life to about 9 hours---also the battery has about 19 hours of secure browsing in it using 2048 bitencryption over bluetooth connect---intense usage such as simultaniuos remote desktop and ssl secure browsing bringtemp to even 120 degree and battery life is 1 hour per 10 percent battery capacity---running linux headless and radio off give you &gt; 40 hours of batteryapache2 server + file sharing + encrypted ssh is on---in linuxthe 14 inch keyboard is backlighted up for your pleasure and for due reasonit is almost impossible to see your key in anything but direct sunlighthowever this is a much needed feature regaurdless  A very usefull feature on the extended keyboard is the well placed home and end keyit follows the standard template for laptops except there is one more row on the far rightwhich has the following keyspower buttonhomepage uppage downendFN*******************************************************************************linux xcfe desktop uses about 1.1 gig of memory out of the installed 4 Gigwith 6 virtual desktops and 5 different apps running*******************************************************************************the charging cord is 6 foot loong and she charges up from 50% to 99% in &gt; a hour*******************************************************************************the integrated video tops out at 1920x1080 and bottoms out at 320x180and refresh rates vary from 60 hz to 120 hzthe battery life sinks exponentialy with increased resolution and refresh rates, I just wanted something simple to use for files and meetings. However, the webcam is awful. The image is poor quality and if you move at all you will be one big blur, so I will need to buy a separate webcam to use. The key clicks are loud as you type, and although the number pad on the mouse pad is a nifty option, it will come on and off when you don't intend it to. Overall, not bad for the price, but the high rating seems to be misleading. Not sure how much I trust Amazon reviews at this point, I saw no mention of the poor quality webcam and that was one thing I noticed right off the bat considering how prevalent Zoom is nowadays., Worked great out of the box but would not turn on the next day.  Shame as it was perfect for my needs., Quit working after a week, It has M.2 which supports NVMe SSD.soldered RAM, works pretty fine to me. I buy it for my daughter and it have all thing that she needs., Perhaps I goofed or something, but even a live boot wouldn't take., It is not user friendly., Well worth the price. Small long battery life. Enough capability to support remote learning, Cheap Chinese garbage, So far the L210 slim laptop is good for working on projects and would make a great investment for a highschool or college grade laptop. Had to make a couple adjustments like uninstall the graphics driver and install the intel one because graphics problems with chrome as well as in chrome disable the \"use hardware acceleration when available\" setting because of graphics errors caused. the other adjustment made was creating my own power plan because with the one that comes pre-made for it doesnt do the laptop much justice. basic power plan was 4-6 hours on battery but with a well setup plan have it setup it can do 6-10 hours with videos and 10-12 hours on everything else from browsing web to having multiple programs running. some stuff you should know is the graphics is 2gb which can handle 1080 videos easy depending on your internet speed. 4gb of ram and barely any is actually used unless you have alot of programs running at once. the processor says 1.2ghz dual core but the speeds that have been running are  1.8-4ghz so far depending on whats running. doesnt get too hot when running games or videos so wont get burns when sitting a your lap. 1 thing tho is that it is listed as having a backlit keyboard but it does not have one. After dealing with windows updates and driver updates theres around 20-25 gb left of space available so if you decide to buy one of these laptops make sure to get a micro sd card for it so you can expand the space and i recommend 120-500 gig., Works good, fast, light weight., Outside of the mouse pad \" I like it a lot.\", It's been more than a month since I got mine and about 3 weeks in the touch pad stopped working. Trying getting it fixed by a technician who wants an arm and a leg to fix it. I'm not a fan of using a mouse so disappointment is an understatement at this stage., Remember you get what you pay for. Very slow but for paying bills and very light gaming it is serviceable., Initially I thought I'd gotten one of those rare deals ... something fairly good for a lower price.  I was being optimistic.1.  Screen saver doesn't work2.  When in \"sleep\", you can't always get the computer to wake up - you have to reboot3.  Applications lock randomly - Chrome, Excel etc - initially thought it happened after the laptop had been idle for awhile - but it happens randomly at any time, even when in use.  Some or all app's become locked/unresponsive and you have to close/restart them4. This is more a personal gripe - the sound quality is very poor.  But again, it's a low end computer so it really should be expected - I just didn't expect the sound to be this bad.On the plus side -1.  It is fairly fast and boots quickly, The picture description says BACK-LIT KEYBOARD, but it isn't! Whomever designed the website for ASUS should be fired! I went through a big hassle trying to find an ASUS laptop that actually had the back-lit keyboard that was advertised on several of their models, but didn't have it! I wound up buying an ASUS 14\" laptop that actually had the ADVERTISED back-lit keyboard from Office Depot/Office Max. I had them verify it before I bought it., USPS delivered this today. Big box with a fairly big box (and padding) in it with a small and light laptop in that. I had it unpacked and charging in no time.Since I never intended to ever use the WIN10 installed on it (or even boot it) it took a bit to figure out how to get into the computer settings so that I could boot from a USB drive that I had Linux Mint installer loaded on.A WORD OF CAUTION for those that are going to install Linux - the current popular install .ISO's don't have the drivers for the WIFI chip! The drivers will have to be installed manually. Bluetooth does however work and I was easily able to link this computer to my iPhone and get out to the internet that way.WORK A ROUND: I ordered a cheap (~$20) \"TP Link\" USB 802.11N (only 2.5Ghz) Wifi adapter, plugged it in and it just works. Maybe someday Linux will have drivers for the built in WiFi chip in this device.While the only CPU'S that Intel makes that are crapper than a Celeron is a Atom I found this on the web:\"The Intel Celeron N4020 is one of the most budget-friendly and power-efficient laptop processors. ... As for gaming, the Intel UHD 600 graphics of the Celeron N4020 is one of the weakest solutions. It can be used only for the lightest games.\"To sum up the above, it is a very cheap and uses very little power.For its size, the keyboard and screen are ok. The keys have good travel. It has a matte screen.This is a small and very light computer. It is 'snappy' enough surfing the web and running Linux native applications. While I'm not clear on this but it appears that it can be charged with a standard USB-C charger.I'll have to take it out in the wild to see how the battery life holds up on it. Running Linux the battery should last as least as long (or longer!) than it does while running WIN10., I bought this laptop to use for leisure travel this next year.  Wanted something bigger and more useful than the tablet I currently have.  While I have just started the setup process, ie loading my apps, files, etc., it is doing exactly what I wanted it to do.  I've switched to Windows Home, installed all my apps and it's currently updating Windows.  It is showing lots of promise!, This was a MAJOR selling feature for me since I work nights. Description needs updated., It's fine otherwise, but the trac pad stopped working a few days after we started using it., Recieved yesterday.Still reading info on using micro soft...... I'm use to Google use but this lap top has much more to offer IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET USE TO IT.., Purchased this laptop in March 2021 and it only lasted six months with light use. One day I could no longer connect to the internet. Ran the troubleshooter and it said it could not find a network adapter. Tried everything suggested, but still can't connect to the internet. Total waste of money!, I am giving this tablet two stars as it is inexpensive (under $200) and lightweight, other than that I would give it one star.  I should have read the description more carefully as it is not a touchscreen model.  Get your fingers to work on the touchpad if hard enough but the way this was designed if you aren't very careful you are constantly turning on the numbering feature.  It is a serious stupid design.  You have all the number above the alpha keys. Grab a calculator if you need it.  I waited too long on return it., Excellent for just information support for your job, 365 micro soft is useless, For the price you can’t complain it works for basic usage as browsing the Internet. I would recommend for anyone who needs a laptop with basic functionality ., Easy to use, up in a second.  I love it.  Then I realized that I couldn't hear a damn thing.  I'm on a computer 12 hours a day, I know how to work them.  I adjusted the controls...blah blah.  Could barely hear the volume on some things, particularly YOUTUBE.  Finally looked and lo and behold, the speaker are on the bottom. How in the hell can speakers project when you have the danged thing in your lap?  My thighs completely block all sound.  So in order to hear certain things, I have to hold it up to my face.  Yes, I've trouble shooted everything. Yes, I know what I'm doing, and Yes, I'm sending it back.  SOUND SUCKS and I don't want to have a little speaker attached to the top so I can hear., Perfect for what it has been designed for: internet browsing, music, playing videos. can play Terraria, Arrived without windows bootingUpon boot enter BIOS and I get “no bootable device”. You can tell the manual has been beat up. When filling in return on Amazon I find support phone number but despite being advertised as open nobody answers., I dislike the confusion with it's programs. Not one to be a \"refresher\" on..after so many years!I feel I made a mistake with choosing this.., Laptop is smaller but has everything you need for school and very light so easy to travel with overall good computer for price, Sound stopped working completely after a week, It won't turn on after having it led than 30 days, What I expected, It’s cute, and quiet, but the screen is made in a way that you HAVE to look at it at a certain angle or it feels weird on your eyes and only the center circle is bright while the edges appear dark.  I’ve never hated a laptop screen so much. It’s almost like it has a privacy screen on it., Well it really wasn't what I was looking for. It's kinda slow, and I really couldn't get too many good apps on it. And it seems much smaller than what it's size is supposed to be., I wanted this laptop to do only one thing - act as the control for a label printer, but it couldn't even do that. It took forever to boot, and everyday tasks kept crashing it. Totally useless! I returned it as soon as I could get it to shutdown., This computer was a great purchase for my son. He likes to play Roblox, Minecraft and Steam games. This computer has the capability and speed to play these games and plenty of room to hold them. It is not a gaming computer but is capable of playing these games without too much lag time. The touchpad that moves the mouse icon does like to stop responding to touch but simply press the F6 key to toggle it back on and off and it will start working or plug in a mouse. The battery lasts an extremely long amount of time. The display is very clear and good quality. Excellent product for the price. The seller, Lucky Trading, has excellent customer service and was very helpful with communication and when I needed product support. Highly recommended., I only needed the computer for zoom.  Whenever I touched the mic I had to hit it several times to turn on mic to speak.  It was a pain so I returned the computer.  I prefer touch screen &amp; a larger screen., It took about ten minutes to download Google Chrome, and when it did, simply opening a new tab on the app took at least two minutes for it to fully load. I bought this laptop to use for writing and schoolwork, but the speed was just unbearable., Much smaller than I imagine but was ok. Easy to carry around, fast enough for my use., Dislike nothing! I use it for work  l like that it was easy to use, It's a laptop and it does laptop things. If you need it to do heavy intensive things, it might not do the things.But if you keep your expectations low, you'll probably not be disappointed., The size and range of motion is pretty coolEdit: the family safety automatically being turned on is irritating. The dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. I’ve taken some mins to set the computer up I don’t want to spend more time, Screen might put some people off. Battery is phenomenal, it’s silent, and the audio is fine. Perfect for on the go.</td>\n",
       "      <td>the laptop arrived just in time for school works great product description very much lied about the keyboard being backlit pretty pissed about that considering it the reason i chose this laptop over others i was looking at otherwise it works fine for the basic little wprd processor i use it for also not a cool design like any online description of the model this one is straight flat black incredibly plainlooking and one of my keys is at a wonky angle but it works considering the ither asus products i own this one falls short honestlyif you want to take it out of s mode go to activation and choose to change your edition to regular windows home its a free switch works goodbut the keyboard is not backlitgood buy if you do not need a backlit keyboard i love how light weight and compact it is and the numeric pad as well so far i am pretty happy and content with it i ordered this small laptop for work purposes and general office operations so far it is been well worth the money i took it out of windows s mode it struggled lagged a bit with chrome so i resorted to using the microsoft internet browser but it is been fine and since i only use it for work general office stuff it is done everything that i could have askedthus far the number dial is pretty accurate sleek design and very lightweight perfect product for the average commuter if you feel that you need the trifling advantage of the easy access numberpad go ahead and buy this one if you do not avoid this oneit is a constant annoyance think you can permanently disable the numberpad good luck with that amazing product it is small do you can easily carry it around with no extra weight for 190 bucks this is perfect i think tablets are very overrated i only like touchscreens on a phone this computer is the size of a tablet incredibly light i just wanted something to do my financial stuff email shop and casually browse the internet i do not watch movies on my computer but it plays you tube type videos just fine sound is a little weak but if i want to listen to music i can cast it to my stereo what i like best is the size and weight small and light and it seems to be built solid i charge it at night and use it off and on all day and there is plenty of juice left i could probably charge it every other night if i wanted i have only had it a couple weeks but i feel very good about my purchase screen was good but touch screen suckedthe lol mouse would disappear from screen and just pop up anywhere and would not click on items the 1st clickit takes multiple clicks to get to where i am trying to go it is perfect for my personal use and easy to navigate light weight and fits into my bag to carry with me i like the size and for the price it is worth buying small compact and convenient stay away from windows 10 s let me tell you what it is trash you cannot download anything from browser unless is from their crappy app store i could not download sketchup this is the worst part you cannot use google like what the f they only allow you to use bing who in the right mind uses that search engine no oneeee you have to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to windows 10 pro to be able to use your brand new computer like a normal person would like to do very very disappointed with this stupid windows 10s upgrade not even an upgrade please do your self a favor and buy a mac my wife bought this for email and facebook essentially i had to uninstall the windows 10s features because it kept freezing on the screen that said only approved windows 10 s apps would workthis warning came up randomly even though the only apps on the laptop were from the microsoft app storefinally i said ok no more windows 10s and dropped it in favor of plain windows 10 since that time there has been no

sure how much i trust amazon reviews at this point i saw no mention of the poor quality webcam and that was one thing i noticed right off the bat considering how prevalent zoom is nowadays worked great out of the box but would not turn on the next day shame as it was perfect for my needs quit working after a week it has m2 which supports nvme ssdsoldered ram works pretty fine to me i buy it for my daughter and it have all thing that she needs perhaps i goofed or something but even a live boot would not take it is not user friendly well worth the price small long battery life enough capability to support remote learning cheap chinese garbage so far the l210 slim laptop is good for working on projects and would make a great investment for a highschool or college grade laptop had to make a couple adjustments like uninstall the graphics driver and install the intel one because graphics problems with chrome as well as in chrome disable the use hardware acceleration when available setting because of graphics errors caused the other adjustment made was creating my own power plan because with the one that comes premade for it does not do the laptop much justice basic power plan was 46 hours on battery but with a well setup plan have it setup it can do 610 hours with videos and 1012 hours on everything else from browsing web to having multiple programs running some stuff you should know is the graphics is 2gb which can handle 1080 videos easy depending on your internet speed 4gb of ram and barely any is actually used unless you have alot of programs running at once the processor says 12ghz dual core but the speeds that have been running are 184ghz so far depending on what is running does not get too hot when running games or videos so will not get burns when sitting a your lap 1 thing though is that it is listed as having a backlit keyboard but it does not have one after dealing with windows updates and driver updates there is around 2025 gb left of space available so if you decide to buy one of these laptops make sure to get a micro sd card for it so you can expand the space and i recommend 120500 gig works good fast light weight outside of the mouse pad i like it a lot it is been more than a month since i got mine and about 3 weeks in the touch pad stopped working trying getting it fixed by a technician who wants an arm and a leg to fix it i am not a fan of using a mouse so disappointment is an understatement at this stage remember you get what you pay for very slow but for paying bills and very light gaming it is serviceable initially i thought i would gotten one of those rare deals something fairly good for a lower price i was being optimistic1 screen saver does not work2 when in sleep you cannot always get the computer to wake up you have to reboot3 applications lock randomly chrome excel etc initially thought it happened after the laptop had been idle for awhile but it happens randomly at any time even when in use some or all apps become lockedunresponsive and you have to closerestart them4 this is more a personal gripe the sound quality is very poor but again it is a low end computer so it really should be expected i just did not expect the sound to be this badon the plus side 1 it is fairly fast and boots quickly the picture description says backlit keyboard but it is not whomever designed the website for asus should be fired i went through a big hassle trying to find an asus laptop that actually had the backlit keyboard that was advertised on several of their models but did not have it i wound up buying an asus 14 laptop that actually had the advertised backlit keyboard from office depotoffice max i had them verify it before i bought it usps delivered this today big box with a fairly big box and padding in it with a small and light laptop in that i had it unpacked and charging in no timesince i never intended to ever use the win10 installed on it or even boot it it took a bit to figure out how to get into the computer settings so that i could boot from a usb drive that i had linux mint installer loaded ona word of caution for those that are going to install linux the current popular install isos do not have the drivers for the wifi chip the drivers will have to be installed manually bluetooth does however work and i was easily able to link this computer to my iphone and get out to the internet that waywork a round i ordered a cheap 20 tp link usb 80211n only 25ghz wifi adapter plugged it in and it just works maybe someday linux will have drivers for the built in wifi chip in this devicewhile the only cpus that intel makes that are crapper than a celeron is a atom i found this on the webthe intel celeron n4020 is one of the most budgetfriendly and powerefficient laptop processors as for gaming the intel uhd 600 graphics of the celeron n4020 is one of the weakest solutions it can be used only for the lightest gamesto sum up the above it is a very cheap and uses very little powerfor its size the keyboard and screen are ok the keys have good travel it has a matte screenthis is a small and very light computer it is snappy enough surfing the web and running linux native applications while i am not clear on this but it appears that it can be charged with a standard usbc chargeri will have to take it out in the wild to see how the battery life holds up on it running linux the battery should last as least as long or longer than it does while running win10 i bought this laptop to use for leisure travel this next year wanted something bigger and more useful than the tablet i currently have while i have just started the setup process ie loading my apps files etc it is doing exactly what i wanted it to do i have switched to windows home installed all my apps and it is currently updating windows it is showing lots of promise this was a major selling feature for me since i work nights description needs updated it is fine otherwise but the trac pad stopped working a few days after we started using it recieved yesterdaystill reading info on using micro soft i am use to google use but this lap top has much more to offer it will take time to get use to it purchased this laptop in march 2021 and it only lasted six months with light use one day i could no longer connect to the internet ran the troubleshooter and it said it could not find a network adapter tried everything suggested but still cannot connect to the internet total waste of money i am giving this tablet two stars as it is inexpensive under 200 and lightweight other than that i would give it one star i should have read the description more carefully as it is not a touchscreen model get your fingers to work on the touchpad if hard enough but the way this was designed if you are not very careful you are constantly turning on the numbering feature it is a serious stupid design you have all the number above the alpha keys grab a calculator if you need it i waited too long on return it excellent for just information support for your job 365 micro soft is useless for the price you cannot complain it works for basic usage as browsing the internet i would recommend for anyone who needs a laptop with basic functionality easy to use up in a second i love it then i realized that i could not hear a damn thing i am on a computer 12 hours a day i know how to work them i adjusted the controlsblah blah could barely hear the volume on some things particularly youtube finally looked and lo and behold the speaker are on the bottom how in the hell can speakers project when you have the danged thing in your lap my thighs completely block all sound so in order to hear certain things i have to hold it up to my face yes i have trouble shooted everything yes i know what i am doing and yes i am sending it back sound sucks and i do not want to have a little speaker attached to the top so i can hear perfect for what it has been designed for internet browsing music playing videos can play terraria arrived without windows bootingupon boot enter bios and i get no bootable device you can tell the manual has been beat up when filling in return on amazon i find support phone number but despite being advertised as open nobody answers i dislike the confusion with it is programs not one to be a refresher onafter so many yearsi feel i made a mistake with choosing this laptop is smaller but has everything you need for school and very light so easy to travel with overall good computer for price sound stopped working completely after a week it will not turn on after having it led than 30 days what i expected it is cute and quiet but the screen is made in a way that you have to look at it at a certain angle or it feels weird on your eyes and only the center circle is bright while the edges appear dark i have never hated a laptop screen so much it is almost like it has a privacy screen on it well it really was not what i was looking for it is kind of slow and i really could not get too many good apps on it and it seems much smaller than what it is size is supposed to be i wanted this laptop to do only one thing act as the control for a label printer but it could not even do that it took forever to boot and everyday tasks kept crashing it totally useless i returned it as soon as i could get it to shutdown this computer was a great purchase

       "      <td>Bought for school work. Doing good so far.Sleek., It's alright, I bought this laptop a week ago. The touch pad worked at first. Once, I upgraded Windows 10. The touch pad stopped working. I went to the Acer site, to download a new driver for this pos. Of course it didn't work. That's why I'm giving this a bad review! I've tried several things to fix this laptop. None of them worked!, My son loves his laptop, One of his favorite devices so far.. One suggestion by memory card to go along with this laptop, I purchased this for my online college classes and am so glad I did. Awesome product!, This computer has totally inadequate volume.  The return was readily accepted by the seller but when I actually took the computer into the UPS store, I had to pay $21 to have it shipped WITH the properly printed return label !  Never had to pay to return an Amazon purchase before!!!!  What a ripoff!!!, Best laptop for this price, 5 star, I love everything about this laptop!, Horribly horrible computer! Do not buy! Screen went out in less than a week! Only used it once or twice before it went to H E double hockey sticks to, The trackpad has scrapes in it when I got it. Returned it, it's been two weeks and I'm being told it will take another 2 weeks for my refund to process. The body is also thin plastic and not metal like some other aspire 7s, including the trackpad. Get another gaming laptop, the ROG zephyrus g14 is on sale at best buy right now for almost the same price with a better GPU &amp; CPU and an all aluminum chassis., Basically the one thing that turned me off is that it warns you not to download the Google browser because it may make it unstable., This will be my last Acer. I expect notebooks to last around  3 years and that is when you actually use it. I used this one as a spare and hardly used it at all. In fact I just found it does not even have a battery that you can take out. I would not recommend this product., GREAT little laptop. Performs well. I do mostly work on it (Microsoft Office, Audio editing on Audacity, minor video editing and some music composition with Sibelius) and it runs flawlessly. Occasionally I travel and play games on it (league of Legends and World of Warcraft) and it runs those just fine too (WoW on lower graphics settings). only down side to this machine is there's VERY little memory. Make absolutely sure you budget for cloud storage, or an external hard drive if you go with this machine., Not nearly enough RAM, slows up with just basic web browsing, This is a great laptop for the price, but the worst thing about it is the placement of the touchpad, it's on the left hand side below the keyboard, which makes no sense.  It should be centered or more on the right.The screen color is also a bit bright, so if you want to edit photos on here beware of that.  Also this thing is kinda heavy., This is not bad, but I would not buy it again. The speakers are horrible and under the computer. making it hard to hear (I am deaf) and you have to pick up the computer to hear them. The cap lock key does not a light on it let you know it is on. Drives me crazy. No CD Rom either.  :(, Love this laptop except why would you put the speakers on the bottom which makes the sound horrible?  At least make the max volume higher so you can at least hear without needing external speakers!, Initially, once I set everything up, I was pretty pleased with my purchase! But after a little over a month (and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month), the screen went black but the back-light on the keyboard was still on. So, I figured it just needed to be charged. I left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it. Still, lit keys but no screen. So I changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more. Came back to it, same thing. I tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference. I never took it out of \"S\" mode, and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs. Basically, just checked my email a few times. Now when I plug it in, nothing lights up. The adapter on the charger doesn't have any indicator light to show that it's working, so it could be a faulty power cord.I'm going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers. But in any case, a brand new device should last longer than a month.Now my return window has closed so I'm either stuck with a $350 paperweight, or I'll have to search online and buy a new charger and hope that works..., I do not spend a lot of time on the computer. I purchased the computer so I could do some personal writing. I like the fact that it had Microsoft Office installed. I did not like the the restriction to only use apps provided through the Microsoft store.  To download other apps, like zoom, I had to disable the Microsoft security system, which cannot now be reactivated on my machine.  But as far as general use of the computer, it has been great., Unfortunately, I have to write a bad review on this one. I have babied this laptop and while it was a decent for cheap laptop, I can't believe it just died on me after 14 months. I didn't get a warranty because the price was more than half of the laptop cost...again, inexpensive laptop. I expect slow, etc. but not death., Easy to set up, liked the keyboard. I added another 4 GB memory.  Just a nice overall laptop., It is a lot smaller screen, keyboard, etc., than I had before.  Though I had an Acer Aspire before.  I don't like it, probably will return it, and wouldn't recomment it for older people., Nice laptop for the money. I still don't like Windows. Battery life is lousy, My lab top has quit working. It will not restart it is froze &amp; my mouse will not work it won’t let me do anything, For the price point its a great laptop. First I added another 2GB RAM for under $20 and upgraded. Before I start with the positive one big negative. When the laptop goes to sleep mode, it take 25-40 sec before it wakes up. It's very strange. Its not a traditional hard drive. I didnt change any settings. I have to hit the power button and literally sit there for it to turn on. Pretty annoying. Other than that screen quality is phenomenal. Speed is more than adequate for MS office apps . It can also handle streaming and 8-10 browsers at a time.  For school, work , anything non hardcore this is a good laptop. Sound quality I aways use my bluetooth headset anyway. Sound is bit more towards the stereo sound. I am sure that can be adjusted, just havn't played with it.Like others have said, you cannot go wrong at this price point. I just hope it lasts and dont bog down or slow down with updates and what not...., this laptop is giving me nightmares. the touchpad is super sensitive to \"accidentally\" turning off. ok, fine. restart and it's back to normal if nothing else works (forgetting the inconvenience). then this morning after an update to windows 10, the touchpad isn't simply off. it isn't in settings, there are no drivers, it's just effing gone. so here i am, using a mouse i hate, because the laptop basically doesn't work as a laptop. take into consideration when thinking about purchasing this model. it's cheap, yes, but if you actually need to use on the go or in your lap, it's a bad choice., I purchased this laptop for general purposes as well as using the Cricut Desgin Space for my Cricut machine. My old laptop was just running too slowly and I needed an upgrade. First off, the price is amazing, and I'm fully aware that you get what you paid for but I feel like I got MORE than I paid for with this. I don't know much about specs and the ins and outs of computers so here are some pros and cons from a general user:PROS:- The look and design is very very sleek- Fairly lightweight- The screen resolution - AMAZING!- It seems fast so far- The battery life is very good. I've been working continuously for about three hours now without it plugged in and I still have 1/4 battery life left.- It does come downloaded with Windows 10 S Mode however there's literally a sticker directly on the box directing you to a website that explains a STUPIDLY EASY four step process to permanently get out of S mode. It was the first thing I did (based on other reviews) and have no issues. IT WAS FREE TO DO AND TOOK 2 MINUTES!!CONS:- Caps Lock/Num Lock do not have an indicator light. I'm already finding this very annoying but I use a USB keyboard most of the time anyway so it's fine.- The sound is awful. If you're using this laptop for streaming, games, etc. you will need headphones. No seriously... it's really bad. The quality is okay but it does not get loud AT ALL.Overall with a couple of days of use I'm impressed with this!!! Purchase ASAP if you're looking for an affordable general use laptop :), I bought this laptop for my wife for her job. I wanted something not pricey and just something that worked. I saw the high amount of five star reviews and I read through some of the lower starred reviews and thought, that won't happen to me, BS!!First of all, the computer got shipped quickly and got here undamaged but that is the only good I can say about it. The backlight for the keyboard goes off quickly and you have to press a key to turn it back on instead of moving the mouse and you cannot change it. As you may have read in other reviews, the computer comes with Windows 10 S Mode installed but my product key is not genuine. It says that the digital license is not valid. Because of this it WILL NOT ACTIVATE WINDOWS. Which means I CANNOT TAKE IT OUT OF S MODE. If the computer is in S Mode then you cannot download any apps or programs that you would normally use like Mozilla or VLC or even Chrome. And furthermore, you cannot access the Command Prompt which means you cannot even activate the Windows even if you wanted to.I have contacted Microsoft who told me that they could not do anything and to contact ACER. I contacted ACER and they told me to try one single thing, which I already did and confirmed that it does not work, then told me I had to send in the laptop to the techs which would take another two weeks just to get it back.Sooooooooooooooooo, long story short, it is a never ending loop of disappointment, anger and resentment and a complete waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE., This laptop was overpriced., Screen quality is decentTouch screen not reallyThis isn’t a gaming laptopTurn off the wifi so it doesnt interfere with your cell phones connectivity or other tablet/computer., Overall, a great laptop for the price. I added 8G of RAM really easily. It is fast and cheap. However, some technical issues:- S mode is horrible. Got rid of it immediately.- My powerpoint screen recording function would not work. Called Microsoft and they were very helpful. They rolled back my display driver to Microsoft Basic and worked perfectly, but then the computer would not recognize my second screen. Called Acer, and they told me they didn't have another display driver to download and referred me to a third party (Answers By) that wanted to charge me $99 to fix the issue...- For some reason, the internet was really slow. Played with two different routers I had. It was still slow even with a tri-band router and no other devices connected to the internet. Then, I connected to the guest wifi I had set up and it worked perfectly. I suspect this may be a driver/software issue.For the price, it is hard to beat this, but get ready for some compatibility issues and no support from ACER..., THIS PC WAS GOOD BUT THE CAMERA DID NOT WORK I OPENED CASE THEY COULD NOT FIS IT  POOR PRODUCT SUPPORT DOD NOT BUY THIS PC  DO NOT BUY THIS PC. VERY POOR SUPPORT FROM AMAZON AND ACER, Product wouldn’t work out of the box, and after an hour with tech support made the decision to return., I love everything about this laptop. Especially the built in Alexa. It's so sleek and stylish. My daughter told me it looked just like her MAC laptop. Best buy anywhere for a laptop at a reasonable price with all the features!, Arrived late, Speaker volume is low.great LT for price! Won’t find anywhere else., Stopped working after 4 months of light use., The first time I attempted to use my webcam for a important Zoom interview, it would not work. After Acer did hours of trouble shooting, with no resolve, they told me I had no other choice but to reset my laptop to factory settings, which meant I lost almost everything I had on my laptop. When it was determined that losing all of my content was for nothing, they finally checked the device manager and discovered that no Webcam drivers had been installed! They then told me that I would have to pay to send the laptop back to them for repairs! I refused to pay out anything more. Needless to say I Will Never purchase from Acer again.!, Hard Drive crashed after 7 months and it was going to cost more than the computer to fix., Product arrived on time and was as advertised.  No surprises., Nothing special about this. Recent buy, no issues thus far. Appreciate the graphics card vs the \"newer model\" with the integrated card. Helps with some lighter games and other graphics-intensive apps., Horrible product. Bought it in March and it keeps disconnecting from the internet, sound is absolutely horrible. Now I have a laptop that is absolutely useless., It will not stay connected to WiFi - I constantly have to reconnect to wifi even after just a few minutes of inactivity., Everything is good for the price but  the volume  is to low... l had to return and get an apple instead. Even though it is double the price., This is a nice laptop for the price.  No issues so far at all.  I did need to take it out of S mode in order to install Zoom which is basically mandatory these days., The batter life is trash, and heats up fast, I bought this entry level Acer as an extra to have around and wasn't expecting much for the price.  Everything about this computer is very good EXCEPT for the low volume of the sound.  I'm not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume. I wasn't expecting BOSE quality, but I was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100%; it isn't.  Here's what I did, checked drivers, opened the Realtek to confirm all were set at 100%.  Upon researching other reviews, I noticed similar low volume issues; it appears that this is where Acer skimped. (I have an entry level Toshiba that has horrible quality sound, but it is loud.) I need to Blu-tooth an external speaker just so I don't have to bring my ears to w/in 8\" just to hear.  Of course, it doesn't help that Acer put the speakers on the bottom, yes, the bottom of the unit. It's a shame that Acer did so much right for the price, only to mess up on a incredibly low volume!  Would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100%?  The answer to my rhetorical question is no, but they did anyway.Overall, I would have given the unit 4 stars, maybe even 5, but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3, at best, unfortunately.My take-away is that I won't buy another Acer without hearing the sound first., built in camera and mic not working, Computer works well. Still trying to learn the operating system as it is different from the last computer., Worked fine for 13 months of occasional use, and then out of nowhere, the motherboard failed--just outside of the mfr warranty window. Piece of junk!, I absolutely love this laptop, key board lights went out and i am a senior citizen with eye problems who runs a help line to get services for families trying to get moms into recovery and am limited in times i can help to day times when i can see the keys, Microsoft edge is the worst browser first off, secondly this laptop did an automatic update and deleted several of my saved documents which are unrecoverable- hours of work are lost. It also blanked out 4x during a timed midterm exam last week.I have had this laptop for just 6 months - sad to say, I won’t purchase Acer again., I purchased this product based on many reviews .  After waiting 30 minutes to set up this thing, I called Acer support.  This thing would not set up Windows.  There is a 22 digit serial number that has to be provided fast and you have to use a telescope since the type is very small and is located no where near where the tech said it was.  Am going on 3 hours now to fully set thing up and am about ready to send it back.  Pure frustration.  This thing has all kinds of features but one important feature it lacks is the ability to set it up without having to take 3 hours of your life to do so.  Recommend you buy something else., overall its an ok computer , but the speakers seems damaged, its extremely low and theres a feedback, Computer works great, just as advertised, good value, would buy again, Works exactly how I expected it to and does everything I need it to do. A very good laptop for the price given., I got this for gaming by day 3 the touch pad stopped working. I troubleshooted it for days. Nothing worked. It only works with a mouse. I was very disappointed. I returned this item and will buy a different brand. Really sucks cause I liked it for gaming☹️, I have been very satisfied with this purchase so far.  I've only had it set up for less than a week, so I can't really state how well the battery is going to be,,,but so far it is great.  I have only had one small problem with setting up the email, but I'm just going on my web browser and accessing it from there, not sure what the problem is, probably something on my \"non-thechie\" side of the screen.  It is a great value for the money and I have absolutely no complaints.  The best feature I have found so far is the back lit keyboard....I had no idea how wonderful this would be....it's great.  I used to have to squint or turn on a light, but not anymore.  It's really an amazing little labptop and the screen is crystal clear.  The speed is very fast and so far I am loving this laptop way more than the last 2 Hewlett Packards that I have had to replace due to faulty battery setting.  I love this computer., Works like a charm, Keyboard start to having pressing issue after a while. Specially the one you use most. Otherwise it’s a great computer, I bought this computer for a new full time remote position. The computer is great for VERY BASIC NEEDS. Only a couple tabs open and browsing the internet. I needed to have 10+ tabs open and be able to toggle back and forth very quickly for my role and this computer could unfortunately not keep up. If you need something faster, I would get the same computer but with an i5 processor for $200 more. Well worth the difference. Have had the new computer for a week and it runs remarkable faster and can keep up with what I need done.Also, I plugged in a bluetooth mouse to this computer, and once I unplugged it, I could not get the touch pad to work anymore, so it is a good thing I am returning it as it also had this alternative issue., backlit keyboard is nice, but I hate to have to pay for word processing.  I hate this \"Gortana\" which pops up all the time., it is a cheaper computer that does its job.But the mouse pad thing doesn't work anymore. so I have to use a external mouse, This has the potential to be a good computer, but Acer ships this in S mode. Windows 10 Home cannot be activated. Running SLUI 4 will open the installation ID, but Microsoft cannot activate that number.  The agent said I needed to call Acer.  I called the toll-free number included with the computer and was told by that agent to call Microsoft (whodathunk?) or send it to Acer to be \"repaired.\"  It was out of the box for ten minutes and they wanted it to be repaired! Thanks to Amazon-- it is being returned.  Run  Away., I purchased this computer for my small business job. Within two weeks of use, the down key came off. Amazon's response is to glue the key down, which is ABSURD. You can't just glue a key down, which I explained, but they said that is all that they could do. They would not replace the computer., I purchased this laptop for school / social media / youtube / browsing &amp; i absolutley love it. No complaints so far., It’s really good I actually got it two days earlier than they said they were going to send it to me which that is great, Not lasting more then 1hr! And lagging when you unplug the cable., Still working on this. Hope to up my rating if we can get things working. First experience with the system was very positive. Issue is that on day two I saw a message in the lower right corner of the screen: \"Go to settings to Activate Windows\". Settings says \"We can't activate Windows on this device because you don't have a valid digital license or product key. If you think you have a valid license or key, select Troubleshoot below. Troubleshooter says \"Something interrupted our troubleshooting.\" Called Acer support and was told they would mail me Windows Installation USB memory stick. Waited a little over one week and asked for status update. Was told that USB install media was not available, and I should contact Microsoft for activation. Entered last four digits from activation error message and was told I would need a new product key. Contacted Acer support again, and was told we would need to return the computer to the factory for fix; which could take 15-20 business days, plus shipping time. Briefly considered returning to Amazon, be decided to try the Acer service option. Will be awhile before we get it back., The physical device is very nice.  Lighted keyboard good EXCEPT no indicators for Caps Lock nor Num Lock.  That is unfortunate (what, Acer saved $2 to not include two little leds). Bluetooth non-operating out of the box so will need to troubleshoot.  Touchpad stopped functioning after a few weeks - another thing to troubleshoot...  Hope that is all the bad stuff that happens to this new machine., We got this as a grad. gift for our grandson. Great price, great laptop &amp; fast delivery!!, Flimsy.  Returned it., Finally unboxed this laptop.. have not used much but the charger that came with it is not original making me think it's a refurbished laptop advertised as 'new' or sent a used one.. will update this review when I've used it a bit..if I don't return it..., It very light weight but not very fast. Screen quality it’s good., Purchased this for a high school kid. Does what it needs to do. The base model is ok. I like that you can upgrade this in the future. They included the bracket for a secondary drive. I will be buying more of these for clients, Works well for school Wish I had read I to description more No sd card or disc reader So cost wasn’t as well as I thought after buying external  readers, Windows does not run as smoothly on the Acer as it did on my Dell. My games do not work as well. Have to refresh page often when searching on internet. Not happy with this product., Can’t complain about an Acer product for the price and quality!, I live everything about it except the battery lifeI constantly has to recharge it to appoint i just kept it plugged most of the time, A good performance., To summarize, you get what you pay for. I was not expecting to run into so many problems right when I took this out of the box.1. Immediately I heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when I pulled it out of its packaging.2. The sound is so bad it's like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store. The speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality.3. Loud fan when it gets a little warm when using.4. Scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs. I had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos I noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs.5. Customer service from both Acer and Amazon makes it difficult to fix your/my issues. I contacted customer service the same day after I received this laptop and also the day after. After telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to Acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed.6. Possible restocking fee. Wanting to return this item, even though I barely used it the first 2 days, customer service told me that I cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it BEFORE they can tell me whether or not I will be charged a restocking fee. If you don't like being surprised by restocking fees, don't buy this laptop so you won't have to return.7, I was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem (basically to spend more money just so I can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file.8. Screen quality is definitely not good. I would give it a 6/10. The color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor, the difference is super noticeable.9. 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me. You would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you're basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usable.I know this has good reviews but don't be fooled by it. I was swayed when I was going through the reviews but after I got my product, I was highly disappointed. I wish I had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop. This one is not worth the regular price. I would say with the issues and quality of this laptop, the price should be around $250., Works fine.  Sound could be louder., I tried 3 of them they perform differently from each other and they appeared to have different hardware suppliers internal parts made by random manufacturers for example M.2 port is only PCIE X2 speed  and advertised internal sata3 port performs about 300mb write and 500mb read on a drive rated 530mb write 550mb read.Over it looks as if it was put together in a hurry debris around plastic body can easily can cut hands skin etc., This laptop is great and I had it for months, but when I first got it I had to pay another 100 dollars to take s mode off of it., The computer itself is great for basic use (checking email, browsing the internet, writing papers, etc). I bought it because I have a MacBook and most Department of Defense websites aren’t compatible with Mac OS. My biggest complaint is that 1 month into owning it, the charging cable doesn’t seem to work anymore and I’m terrified for the day that the battery dies and I have no way of charging it after that., Not good as described. Not hapoy with battery performance., It's a great laptop sometimes it can act a bit uppity but just restart it if you just installed some apps. Also it comes on S mode which you can change to regular windows 10 for FREE!  Go in settings &gt; application &gt; Switch to windows 10 mode, Good laptop but ended returning, found one better., Cheap laptop.  You get what you pay for.  No hard drive.  No cd player.  Mouse board difficult to control., The product key on the laptop was bad and so I could not activate it. Acer customer support was horrible, told me if I had bought it directly from them they could have given me a new product key but since I bought it from Amazon I'm pretty much on my own. Last time I buy this brand., Machine is a really great budget machine. I got it for my wife for school but more than just a throw away machine. In the standard form, it was nothing great. Adding more RAM woke it up a lot. Better overall performance.The back-lit keyboard is huge plus for working at night. Screen resolution and clarity is great as well., I had to return my laptop after the mouse cursor had mysteriously quit working after 3 days of use. While I am used toto Apple products, I tried troubleshooting my Windows laptop, even tried restarting in Safe Mode to troubleshoot, without resolve. I even performed Windows Recovery. Still, no resolve. Confused, I thought, That’s okay, I am within the allotted time to return my laptop. So, I requested a Return and opted for a new replacement (vs. refund). I was careful to ensure I remained in compliance with the Return Policy as set out by Amazon and followed the instructions, step-by-step. I downloaded the RA# and UPS label provided and used it to return my laptop as instructed. The following day, I checked the Amazon website for status of my return, only to discover that all information about my return mysteriously disappeared! I didn’t think much of it as more than a temporary technical error, as it was admittedly nearing the deadline for return. Having carefully followed instructions per Amazon’s Return Policy and with my Proof of Shipment Receipt from UPS, I was confident it would work itself out. NOPE. Evidently not. More than two weeks later, NO REPLACEMENT, NO REFUND, NO RESPONSE. …NO COMMUNICATION. And, Four to Five text messages later to the Seller (via Amazon website) — along w/ submission of my proof of shipment receipt and tracking# — STILL NO RECORD OF iNITIATION OR TRACKING OF MY RETURN. The History of my messages to Amazon / Seller and my Return Request are also *POOF* GONE!What the $&amp;@! NO PHONE NUMBERS; Just the runAround.Apparently, I am now out $500 — AND a laptop. …Fabulous.KNOW THE RISK!, This laptop is 14\"!!! I'm soooo angry!, This laptop is great, its affordable and have a bunch of cool features. The only issue is that it is extremely low. you definitely need a headset or speakers. I have to lift the device to my ears to hear if I dont have any of these available.  I have had it for a year and so far so good., I love it.  Easy to work with, screen is small. whole computer is really a tiny bit larger than a notebook, but the processor is fast and all.. I thought i was upgrading, but i have to wear glasses when using this thing to see the letters., I HAVE ORDERED FOUR ACER LAPTOPS FROM AMAZON IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND LOVE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE BUY A FIFTH ACER LAPTOP, AFTER READING ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS ONE. THEY WERE WRONG AND VERY MISLEADING. I SHOULD HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, THEY WERE ACCURATE. THIS ACER LAPTOP WAS THE WORST, SOUND SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE, YOU CAN BARELY HEAR IT EVEN IF YOU TURN IT UP TO THE MAX, THE MOUSE PAD AND KEYS WERE UNRESPONSIVE, CAN'T ADJUST THE SETTINGS, ETC. I USED IT FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY MINUTES,..... 30 MINUTES  AFTER I CHARGED IT AND I PUT IT RIGHT BACK  IN THE PACKAGING.  I COULD NOT GET IT OUT OF MY HOUSE FAST ENOUGH.  WITHIN AN HOUR, I CALLED AMAZON FOR RETURN AUTHORIZATION TO PICK UP THE LAPTOP THE FOLLOWING DAY.  I GOT MY FULL REFUND, AMAZON'S EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE SAVED THE DAY.  GREATLY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS ACER LAPTOP. BUYER BEWARE., Cons:-over heats-speakers are horrible can barely hear videos (had to install an additional app to make sound louder)-computer lags a bit (shouldn’t lag for the price of it)- not recommend for the pricePros:-Good quality when watching videos etc, I like everything about this computer EXCEPT THE VOLUME-YOU CAN BARELY HEAR ANYTHING ON IT!, dislike the teeny hddlike I can throw an external drive on it and am gtg after taking it OUT of s modenear perfect for my needs and decent price, Not touchscreen as was advertised in the question and answer section. The graphics are so so. Worse than my last Acer. Overall 4 stars., Good computer. I’m using it to create elearning.When I tried to remove the computer from Windows S mode, I realized that the computer did not come with a product key. What this means is in order to remove S mode, you have to buy Windows Home or Pro and use the product key to remove S mode. I wish they would have just told me that! I contacted the company via amazon chat, they said I needed to contact the manufacturer. They gave me a phone number. There is a button on amazon to contact the manufacturer as well. No success.I ended up just buying the downloadable Windows home version and used the product key to remove S mode. I also purchased the microsoft software for powerpoint, word, excel, etc.That's a lot of drama just to be able to download things to my computer. Just know that you are buying a bare bones computer when you purchase., Was a great computer until I had used it twice for Zoom and now the speakers no longer work.  If I figure out why I will update., When I first received this laptop everything seemed great, I was very excited to set it up with my personal information and get going-- I very quickly realized, however, that this computer was EXTREMELY slow for my tastes.  Even with no background programs, simple tasks like opening file explorer or a web browser took far too much time.  In my opinion, a brand new computer should be opening programs almost instantly, not leaving me waiting a few seconds or more.  This is ultimately preference, but I'm sure there are many more laptops out there for a similar price point that would run much faster.  Returned this after only a day or so of having it and ended up with another laptop from the early 2010's and it runs much better than this one., I had this laptop for about 2 months now and I'm loving it so far. It's lightweight, sleek, and the backlit keys are great for me in my dark room. It boots up in seconds ready to go when you turn it on. I mostly use this for watching videos and streams and excels it that. The only negative that I can think of is the placement of the speakers. The speakers are placed on the bottom and really muffle the sound so my volume is always at max. Other than that the laptop is a great budget buy., Displeased. Some black (looks more like green) dotted lines are running down the middle of my screen. Looks like some kind of defect. The laptop was purchased at the start of September and didnt see usage until about the 25th of September, which means In about two months this situation happened. Was satisfied with my purchase before this occurrence., I’m not sure if it has “touch screen”., Poor quality. Cheap, just like the price. Laptop is unlikely to last you long. Charging port was junk.On the positive side, it is very light and small.If you choose to purchase this laptop, best of luck to you., The battery died after a week and the screen started blinking. I needed to connect an external monitor to work. BAD BAD BAD., I was told I was going to get a new battery sent to me because every since I have the laptop it will only turn on if it is plugged in to the wall and i never received a new one.., very cheesy one , keep freezing ,not able open files or photos , not going waste my time to fight that, I love this laptop. The screen is a great size. It’s light weight not heavy and very sleek., Good laptop, I don't do anything out of the ordinary.  Does what a laptop is made to do.  I stayed with ACER because my previous laptop was ACER.  If it didn't lose the 'W' key function I'd still be using it, but would buy a new battery because unless it's plugged in it randomly shuts down, bad battery. So, the new laptop had a new surprise.  The sound volume is very poor.  Now lugging a wifi speaker along wherever the laptop goes.  I have to not recommend for this very reason., Absolute garbage, I really dont write reviews but when I do I usually make them for the people this laptop is good when it works but I only used this about 10 times and now it does not charge or turn on pretty much got robbed I'm really disappointed I was really hyped about this product but no durability whatsoever no scratch or anything looks brand new and it's a lemon buyers beware., Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop 15.6 inches Full HD computer stop working this month July 2021.  I purchase this item in October 2020 as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  Unfortunately, the computer has stop working and the battery will not charge.  Please contact me in reference to the warranty information.  I would not purchase another computer through AMAZON.  No customer service support when needed., bought this for my brother laid up with back surgery-easy to work great graphics and definitely user friendly!, All ok so far, cute unit--but does not work after two hours =  black screen &amp; deadmay i have a replacement unit?, I love this computer, but the mouse pad doesn’t work. Had to buy a wireless mouse to even use it. But otherwise great product, Good quality, use it to work from home and meetings and classed., I faced several issues with this PC in spite on light usage. First google meet does not work on all browsers and suddenly mutes the conversation. We spent ages trying to solve this problem until we discovered that it works only on microsoft edge.Sound quality is not clear and low.Finally the battery stopped charging and the laptop does not work except when it is plugged in power. All of this happened after less than 8 months of usage.A total waste of money, The product arrived with a bad wireless card. I returned the item and the refund was applied to a Amazon gift card instead of my credit card. I am not happy., I’ve had this computer for a year and for some reason the computer won’t work unless it’s plugged in. I originally got it for college, but the pandemic caused me to stay and do school at home. I haven’t spilled anything or dropped the computer so I don’t know what the problem is., Nice PC but the backlighting went out after 3 weeks and Acer couldn't help me. Having a laptop without being able to see the keys is not good., Bought one year ago, already falling apart. Lacks durability.  Good for a few months, then you'll need a new one.  The input to the power cord is broken and now the laptop won't charge.  The lever that opens and closes the laptop pulled apart. Stay away.  Terrible quality., I baught this laptop and after just a month and a half the mouse pad won't work. Scam, ALL ELSE OK, I regret buying this laptop and spending all the extra money in shipping.I am having two major troubles with this laptop:1 - The laptop slows down and lags badly once unplugged from power. It runs fast and fine when plugged. It's so bad. I have gone to Control panel and under power settings created a different profile for high performance and gone to advanced power settings and set everything to high performance and still the issue persists.I upgraded the RAM to 16GB. Same issue. I have done countless troubleshooting as seen on different websites, my windows is updated. I have switched off most background and start-up apps and it's still same. I just don't understand why I can't have the freedom to use my laptop at high performance when unplugged. This is crazy. I'm suspecting AMD and Acer to be behind this. This issue sometimes doesn't happen but most times it does.2. Second issue is that when connected to hotspot, this device will from time to time shut off internet connection for not obvious reason.So I could be in the middle of an important zoom meeting and off she goes.Don't buy this if you want peace of mind. The back cover also is inferior plastic., Considering I had a Toshiba laptop for over 10 years with no problems, I expected better of this. But two months into it the touch pad and cursor died. Fortunately I still had the wireless mouse and keyboard so the laptop is still functional.I don't have the time or patience to fool around with a return. When I buy a product I expect it to work. We'll see how long it lasts., Track pad broke within 1 month of use. Amazon was no help., Extremely happy with this. I have a laptop i can take on the go for long business trips even upgraded the ram to make it even better. Glad i found this.</td>\n",
       "      <td>bought for school work doing good so farsleek it is alright i bought this laptop a week ago the touch pad worked at first once i upgraded windows 10 the touch pad stopped working i went to the acer site to download a new driver for this pos of course it did not work that is why i am giving this a bad review i have tried several things to fix this laptop none of them worked my son loves his laptop one of his favorite devices so far one suggestion by memory card to go along with this laptop i purchased this for my online college classes and am so glad i did awesome product this computer has totally inadequate volume the return was readily accepted by the seller but when i actually took the computer into the ups store i had to pay 21 to have it shipped with the properly printed return label never had to pay to return an amazon purchase before what a ripoff best laptop for this price 5 star i love everything about this laptop horribly horrible computer do not buy screen went out in less than a week only used it once or twice before it went to h e double hockey sticks to the trackpad has scrapes in it when i got it returned it it is been two weeks and i am being told it will take another 2 weeks for my refund to process the body is also thin plastic and not metal like some other aspire 7s including the trackpad get another gaming laptop the rog zephyrus g14 is on sale at best buy right now for almost the same price with a better gpu cpu and an all aluminum chassis basically the one thing that turned me off is that it warns you not to download the google browser because it may make it unstable this will be my last acer i expect notebooks to last around 3 years and that is when you actually use it i used this one as a spare and hardly used it at all in fact i just found it does not even have a battery that you can take out i would not recommend this product great little laptop performs well i do mostly work on it microsoft office audio editing on audacity minor video editing and some music composition with sibelius and it runs flawlessly occasionally i travel and play games on it league of legends and world of warcraft and it runs those just fine too wow on lower graphics settings only down side to this machine is there is very little memory make absolutely sure you budget for cloud storage or an external hard drive if you go with this machine not nearly enough ram slows up with just basic web browsing this is a great laptop for the price but the worst thing about it is the placement of the touchpad it is on the left hand side below the keyboard which makes no sense it should be centered or more on the rightthe screen color is also a bit bright so if you want to edit photos on here beware of that also this thing is kind of heavy this is not bad but i would not buy it again the speakers are horrible and under the computer making it hard to hear i am deaf and you have to pick up the computer to hear them the cap lock key does not a light on it let you know it is on drives me crazy no cd rom either love this laptop except why would you put the speakers on the bottom which makes the sound horrible at least make the max volume higher so you can at least hear without needing external speakers initially once i set everything up i was pretty pleased with my purchase but after a little over a month and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month the screen went black but the backlight on the keyboard was still on so i figured it just needed to be charged i left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it still lit keys but no screen so i changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more came back to it same thing i tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference i never took it out of s mode and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs basically just checked my email a few times now when i plug it in nothing lights up the adapter on the charger does not have any indicator light to show that it is working so it could be a faulty power cordi am going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers but in any case a brand new device should last longer than a monthnow my return window has closed so i am either stuck with a 350 paperweight or i will have to search online and buy a new charger and hope that works i do not spend a lot of time on the computer i purchased the computer so i could do some personal writing i like the fact that it had microsoft office installed i did not like the the restriction to only use apps provided through the microsoft store to download other apps like zoom i had to disable the microsoft security system which cannot now be reactivated on my machine but as far as general use of the computer it has been great unfortunately i have to write a bad review on this one i have babied this laptop and while it was a decent for cheap laptop i cannot believe it just died on me after 14 months i did not get a warranty because the price was more than half of the laptop costagain inexpensive laptop i expect slow etc but not death easy to set up liked the keyboard i added another 4 gb memory just a nice overall laptop it is a lot smaller screen keyboard etc than i had before though i had an acer aspire before i do not like it probably will return it and would not recomment it for older people nice laptop for the money i still do not like windows battery life is lousy my lab top has quit working it will not restart it is froze my mouse will not work it will not let me do anything for the price point its a great laptop first i added another 2gb ram for under 20 and upgraded before i start with the positive one big negative when the laptop goes to sleep mode it take 2540 sec before it wakes up it is very strange its not a traditional hard drive i did not change any settings i have to hit the power button and literally sit there for it to turn on pretty annoying other than that screen quality is phenomenal speed is more than adequate for ms office apps it can also handle streaming and 810 browsers at a time for school work anything non hardcore this is a good laptop sound quality i aways use my bluetooth headset anyway sound is bit more towards the stereo sound i am sure that can be adjusted just havnt played with itlike others have said you cannot go wrong at this price point i just hope it lasts and do not bog down or slow down with updates and what not this laptop is giving me nightmares the touchpad is super sensitive to accidentally turning off ok fine restart and it is back to normal if nothing else works forgetting the inconvenience then this morning after an update to windows 10 the touchpad is not simply off it is not in settings there are no drivers it is just effing gone so here i am using a mouse i hate because the laptop basically does not work as a laptop take into consideration when thinking about purchasing this model it is cheap yes but if you actually need to use on the go or in your lap it is a bad choice i purchased this laptop for general purposes as well as using the cricut desgin space for my cricut machine my old laptop was just running too slowly and i needed an upgrade first off the price is amazing and i am fully aware that you get what you paid for but i feel like i got more than i paid for with this i do not know much about specs and the ins and outs of computers so here are some pros and cons from a general userpros the look and design is very very sleek fairly lightweight the screen resolution amazing it seems fast so far the battery life is very good i have been working continuously for about three hours now without it plugged in and i still have 14 battery life left it does come downloaded with windows 10 s mode however there is literally a sticker directly on the box directing you to a website that explains a stupidly easy four step process to permanently get out of s mode it was the first thing i did based on other reviews and have no issues it was free to do and took 2 minutescons caps locknum lock do not have an indicator light i am already finding this very annoying but i use a usb keyboard most of the time anyway so it is fine the sound is awful if you are using this laptop for streaming games etc you will need headphones no seriously it is really bad the quality is okay but it does not get loud at alloverall with a couple of days of use i am impressed with this purchase as soon as possible if you are looking for an affordable general use laptop i bought this laptop for my wife for her job i wanted something not pricey and just something that worked i saw the high amount of five star reviews and i read through some of the lower starred reviews and thought that will not happen to me bsfirst of all the computer got shipped quickly and got here undamaged but that is the only good i can say about it the backlight for the keyboard goes off quickly and you have to press a key to turn it back on instead of moving the mouse and you cannot change it as you may have read in other reviews the computer comes with windows 10 s mode installed but my product key is not genuine it says that the digital license is not valid because of this it will not activate windows which means i cannot take it out of s mode if the computer is in s mode then you cannot download any apps or programs that you would normally use like mozilla or vlc or even chrome and furthermore you cannot access the command prompt which means you cannot even activate the windows even if you wanted toi have contacted microsoft who told me that they could not do anything and to contact acer i contacted acer and they told me to try one single thing which i already did and confirmed that it does not work then told me i had to send in the laptop to the techs which would take another two weeks just to get it backsooooooooooooooooo long story short it is a never ending loop of disappointment anger and resentment and a complete waste of time and money do not buy save yourself the trouble this laptop was overpriced screen quality is decenttouch screen not reallythis is not a gaming laptopturn off the wifi so it does not interfere with your cell phones connectivity or other tabletcomputer overall a great laptop for the price i added 8g of ram really easily it is fast and cheap however some technical issues s mode is horrible got rid of it immediately my powerpoint screen recording function would not work called microsoft and they were very helpful they rolled back my display driver to microsoft basic and worked perfectly but then the computer would not recognize my second screen called acer and they told me they did not have another display driver to download and referred me to a third party answers by that wanted to charge me 99 to fix the issue for some reason the internet was really slow played with two different routers i had it was still slow even with a triband router and no other devices connected to the internet then i connected to the guest wifi i had set up and it worked perfectly i suspect this may be a driversoftware issuefor the price it is hard to beat this but get ready for some compatibility issues and no support from acer this pc was good but the camera did not work i opened case they could not fis it poor product support dod not buy this pc do not buy this pc very poor support from amazon and acer product would not work out of the box and after an hour with tech support made the decision to return i love everything about this laptop especially the built in alexa it is so sleek and stylish my daughter told me it looked just like her mac laptop best buy anywhere for a laptop at a reasonable price with all the features arrived late speaker volume is lowgreat lt for price will not find anywhere else stopped working after 4 months of light use the first time i attempted to use my webcam for a important zoom interview it would not work after acer did hours of trouble shooting with no resolve they told me i had no other choice but to reset my laptop to factory settings which meant i lost almost everything i had on my laptop when it was determined that losing all of my content was for nothing they finally checked the device manager and discovered that no webcam drivers had been installed they then told me that i would have to pay to send the laptop back to them for repairs i refused to pay out anything more needless to say i will never purchase from acer again hard drive crashed after 7 months and it was going to cost more than the computer to fix product arrived on time and was as advertised no surprises nothing special about this recent buy no issues thus far appreciate the graphics card vs the newer model with the integrated card helps with some lighter games and other graphicsintensive apps horrible product bought it in march and it keeps disconnecting from the internet sound is absolutely horrible now i have a laptop that is absolutely useless it will not stay connected to wifi i constantly have to reconnect to wifi even after just a few minutes of inactivity everything is good for the price but the volume is to low l had to return and get an apple instead even though it is double the price this is a nice laptop for the price no issues so far at all i did need to take it out of s mode in order to install zoom which is basically mandatory these days the batter life is trash and heats up fast i bought this entry level acer as an extra to have around and was not expecting much for the price everything about this computer is very good except for the low volume of the sound i am not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume i was not expecting bose quality but i was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100 it is not here is what i did checked drivers opened the realtek to confirm all were set at 100 upon researching other reviews i noticed similar low volume issues it appears that this is where acer skimped i have an entry level toshiba that has horrible quality sound but it is loud i need to blutooth an external speaker just so i do not have to bring my ears to win 8 just to hear of course it does not help that acer put the speakers on the bottom yes the bottom of the unit it is a shame that acer did so much right for the price only to mess up on a incredibly low volume would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100 the answer to my rhetorical question is no but they did anywayoverall i would have given the unit 4 stars maybe even 5 but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3 at best unfortunatelymy takeaway is that i will not buy another acer without hearing the sound first built in camera and mic not working computer works well still trying to learn the operating system as it is different from the last computer worked fine for 13 months of occasional use and then out of nowhere the motherboard failedjust outside of the mfr warranty window piece of junk i absolutely love this laptop key board lights went out and i am a senior citizen with eye problems who runs a help line to get services for families trying to get moms into recovery and am limited in times i can help to day times when i can see the keys microsoft edge is the worst browser first off secondly this laptop did an automatic update and deleted several of my saved documents which are unrecoverable hours of work are lost it also blanked out 4x during a timed midterm exam last weeki have had this laptop for just 6 months sad to say i will not purchase acer again i purchased this product based on many reviews after waiting 30 minutes to set up this thing i called acer support this thing would not set up windows there is a 22 digit serial number that has to be provided fast and you have to use a telescope since the type is very small and is located no where near where the tech said it was am going on 3 hours now to fully set thing up and am about ready to send it back pure frustration this thing has all kinds of features but one important feature it lacks is the ability to set it up without having to take 3 hours of your life to do so recommend you buy something else overall its an ok computer but the speakers seems damaged its extremely low and there is a feedback computer works great just as advertised good value would buy again works exactly how i expected it to and does everything i need it to do a very good laptop for the price given i got this for gaming by day 3 the touch pad stopped working i troubleshooted it for days nothing worked it only works with a mouse i was very disappointed i returned this item and will buy a different brand really sucks because i liked it for gaming i have been very satisfied with this purchase so far i have only had it set up for less than a week so i cannot really state how well the battery is going to bebut so far it is great i have only had one small problem with setting up the email but i am just going on my web browser and accessing it from there not sure what the problem is probably something on my nonthechie side of the screen it is a great value for the money and i have absolutely no complaints the best feature i have found so far is the back lit keyboardi had no idea how wonderful this would beit is great i used to have to squint or turn on a light but not anymore it is really an amazing little labptop and the screen is crystal clear the speed is very fast and so far i am loving this laptop way more than the last 2 hewlett packards that i have had to replace due to faulty battery setting i love this computer works like a charm keyboard start to having pressing issue after a while specially the one you use most otherwise it is a great computer i bought this computer for a new full time remote position the computer is great for very basic needs only a couple tabs open and browsing the internet i needed to have 10 tabs open and be able to toggle back and forth very quickly for my role and this computer could unfortunately not keep up if you need something faster i would get the same computer but with an i5 processor for 200 more well worth the difference have had the new computer for a week and it runs remarkable faster and can keep up with what i need donealso i plugged in a bluetooth mouse to this computer and once i unplugged it i could not get the touch pad to work anymore so it is a good thing i am returning it as it also had this alternative issue backlit keyboard is nice but i hate to have to pay for word processing i hate this gortana which pops up all the time it is a cheaper computer that does its jobbut the mouse pad thing does not work anymore so i have to use a external mouse this has the potential to be a good computer but acer ships this in s mode windows 10 home cannot be activated running slui 4 will open the installation id but microsoft cannot activate that number the agent said i needed to call acer i called the tollfree number included with the computer and was told by that agent to call microsoft whodathunk or send it to acer to be repaired it was out of the box for ten minutes and they wanted it to be repaired thanks to amazon it is being returned run away i purchased this computer for my small business job within two weeks of use the down key came off amazons response is to glue the key down which is absurd you cannot just glue a key down which i explained but they said that is all that they could do they would not replace the computer i purchased this laptop for school social media youtube browsing i absolutley love it no complaints so far it is really good i actually got it two days earlier than they said they were going to send it to me which that is great not lasting more then 1hr and lagging when you unplug the cable still working on this hope to up my rating if we can get things working first experience with the system was very positive issue is that on day two i saw a message in the lower right corner of the screen go to settings to activate windows settings says we cannot activate windows on this device because you do not have a valid digital license or product key if you think you have a valid license or key select troubleshoot below troubleshooter says something interrupted our troubleshooting called acer support and was told they would mail me windows installation usb memory stick waited a little over one week and asked for status update was told that usb install media was not available and i should contact microsoft for activation entered last four digits from activation error message and was told i would need a new product key contacted acer support again and was told we would need to return the computer to the factory for fix which could take 1520 business days plus shipping time briefly considered returning to amazon be decided to try the acer service option will be awhile before we get it back the physical device is very nice lighted keyboard good except no indicators for caps lock nor num lock that is unfortunate what acer saved 2 to not include two little leds bluetooth nonoperating out of the box so will need to troubleshoot touchpad stopped functioning after a few weeks another thing to troubleshoot hope that is all the bad stuff that happens to this new machine we got this as a grad gift for our grandson great price great laptop fast delivery flimsy returned it finally unboxed this laptop have not used much but the charger that came with it is not original making me think it is a refurbished laptop advertised as new or sent a used one will update this review when i have used it a bitif i do not return it it very light weight but not very fast screen quality it is good purchased this for a high school kid does what it needs to do the base model is ok i like that you can upgrade this in the future they included the bracket for a secondary drive i will be buying more of these for clients works well for school wish i had read i to description more no sd card or disc reader so cost was not as well as i thought after buying external readers windows does not run as smoothly on the acer as it did on my dell my games do not work as well have to refresh page often when searching on internet not happy with this product cannot complain about an acer product for the price and quality i live everything about it except the battery lifei constantly has to recharge it to appoint i just kept it plugged most of the time a good performance to summarize you get what you pay for i was not expecting to run into so many problems right when i took this out of the box1 immediately i heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when i pulled it out of its packaging2 the sound is so bad it is like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store the speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality3 loud fan when it gets a little warm when using4 scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs i had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos i noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs5 customer service from both acer and amazon makes it difficult to fix yourmy issues i contacted customer service the same day after i received this laptop and also the day after after telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed6 possible restocking fee wanting to return this item even though i barely used it the first 2 days customer service told me that i cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it before they can tell me whether or not i will be charged a restocking fee if you do not like being surprised by restocking fees do not buy this laptop so you will not have to return7 i was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem basically to spend more money just so i can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file8 screen quality is definitely not good i would give it a 610 the color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor the difference is super noticeable9 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me you would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you are basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usablei know this has good reviews but do not be fooled by it i was swayed when i was going through the reviews but after i got my product i was highly disappointed i wish i had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop this one is not worth the regular price i would say with the issues and quality of this laptop the price should be around 250 works fine sound could be louder i tried 3 of them they perform differently from each other and they appeared to have different hardware suppliers internal parts made by random manufacturers for example m2 port is only pcie x2 speed and advertised internal sata3 port performs about 300mb write and 500mb read on a drive rated 530mb write 550mb readover it looks as if it was put together in a hurry debris around plastic body can easily can cut hands skin etc this laptop is great and i had it for months but when i first got it i had to pay another 100 dollars to take s mode off of it the computer itself is great for basic use checking email browsing the internet writing papers etc i bought it because i have a macbook and most department of defense websites are not compatible with mac os my biggest complaint is that 1 month into owning it the charging cable does not seem to work anymore and i am terrified for the day that the battery dies and i have no way of charging it after that not good as described not hapoy with battery performance it is a great laptop sometimes it can act a bit uppity but just restart it if you just installed some apps also it comes on s mode which you can change to regular windows 10 for free go in settings application switch to windows 10 mode good laptop but ended returning found one better cheap laptop you get what you pay for no hard drive no cd player mouse board difficult to control the product key on the laptop was bad and so i could not activate it acer customer support was horrible told me if i had bought it directly from them they could have given me a new product key but since i bought it from amazon i am pretty much on my own last time i buy this brand machine is a really great budget machine i got it for my wife for school but more than just a throw away machine in the standard form it was nothing great adding more ram woke it up a lot better overall performancethe backlit keyboard is huge plus for working at night screen resolution and clarity is great as well i had to return my laptop after the mouse cursor had mysteriously quit working after 3 days of use while i am used toto apple products i tried troubleshooting my windows laptop even tried restarting in safe mode to troubleshoot without resolve i even performed windows recovery still no resolve confused i thought that is okay i am within the allotted time to return my laptop so i requested a return and opted for a new replacement vs refund i was careful to ensure i remained in compliance with the return policy as set out by amazon and followed the instructions stepbystep i downloaded the ra and ups label provided and used it to return my laptop as instructed the following day i checked the amazon website for status of my return only to discover that all information about my return mysteriously disappeared i did not think much of it as more than a temporary technical error as it was admittedly nearing the deadline for return having carefully followed instructions per amazons return policy and with my proof of shipment receipt from ups i was confident it would work itself out nope evidently not more than two weeks later no replacement no refund no response no communication and four to five text messages later to the seller via amazon website along w submission of my proof of shipment receipt and tracking still no record of initiation or tracking of my return the history of my messages to amazon seller and my return request are also poof gonewhat the no phone numbers just the runaroundapparently i am now out 500 and a laptop fabulousknow the risk this laptop is 14 i am soooo angry this laptop is great its affordable and have a bunch of cool features the only issue is that it is extremely low you definitely need a headset or speakers i have to lift the device to my ears to hear if i do not have any of these available i have had it for a year and so far so good i love it easy to work with screen is small whole computer is really a tiny bit larger than a notebook but the processor is fast and all i thought i was upgrading but i have to wear glasses when using this thing to see the letters i have ordered four acer laptops from amazon in the last two years and love each and every one of them i thought it would be nice buy a fifth acer laptop after reading all the positive reviews on this one they were wrong and very misleading i should have paid attention to the negative reviews they were accurate this acer laptop was the worst sound system was terrible you can barely hear it even if you turn it up to the max the mouse pad and keys were unresponsive cannot adjust the settings etc i used it for a total of thirty minutes 30 minutes after i charged it and i put it right back in the packaging i could not get it out of my house fast enough within an hour i called amazon for return authorization to pick up the laptop the following day i got my full refund amazons excellent customer service saved the day greatly disappointed by this acer laptop buyer beware consover heatsspeakers are horrible can barely hear videos had to install an additional app to make sound loudercomputer lags a bit should not lag for the price of it not recommend for the priceprosgood quality when watching videos etc i like everything about this computer except the volumeyou can barely hear anything on it dislike the teeny hddlike i can throw an external drive on it and am gtg after taking it out of s modenear perfect for my needs and decent price not touchscreen as was advertised in the question and answer section the graphics are so so worse than my last acer overall 4 stars good computer i am using it to create elearningwhen i tried to remove the computer from windows s mode i realized that the computer did not come with a product key what this means is in order to remove s mode you have to buy windows home or pro and use the product key to remove s mode i wish they would have just told me that i contacted the company via amazon chat they said i needed to contact the manufacturer they gave me a phone number there is a button on amazon to contact the manufacturer as well no successi ended up just buying the downloadable windows home version and used the product key to remove s mode i also purchased the microsoft software for powerpoint word excel etcthat is a lot of drama just to be able to download things to my computer just know that you are buying a bare bones computer when you purchase was a great computer until i had used it twice for zoom and now the speakers no longer work if i figure out why i will update when i first received this laptop everything seemed great i was very excited to set it up with my personal information and get going i very quickly realized however that this computer was extremely slow for my tastes even with no background programs simple tasks like opening file explorer or a web browser took far too much time in my opinion a brand new computer should be opening programs almost instantly not leaving me waiting a few seconds or more this is ultimately preference but i am sure there are many more laptops out there for a similar price point that would run much faster returned this after only a day or so of having it and ended up with another laptop from the early 2010s and it runs much better than this one i had this laptop for about 2 months now and i am loving it so far it is lightweight sleek and the backlit keys are great for me in my dark room it boots up in seconds ready to go when you turn it on i mostly use this for watching videos and streams and excels it that the only negative that i can think of is the placement of the speakers the speakers are placed on the bottom and really muffle the sound so my volume is always at max other than that the laptop is a great budget buy displeased some black looks more like green dotted lines are running down the middle of my screen looks like some kind of defect the laptop was purchased at the start of september and did not see usage until about the 25th of september which means in about two months this situation happened was satisfied with my purchase before this occurrence i am not sure if it has touch screen poor quality cheap just like the price laptop is unlikely to last you long charging port was junkon the positive side it is very light and smallif you choose to purchase this laptop best of luck to you the battery died after a week and the screen started blinking i needed to connect an external monitor to work bad bad bad i was told i was going to get a new battery sent to me because every since i have the laptop it will only turn on if it is plugged in to the wall and i never received a new one very cheesy one keep freezing not able open files or photos not going waste my time to fight that i love this laptop the screen is a great size it is light weight not heavy and very sleek good laptop i do not do anything out of the ordinary does what a laptop is made to do i stayed with acer because my previous laptop was acer if it did not lose the w key function i would still be using it but would buy a new battery because unless it is plugged in it randomly shuts down bad battery so the new laptop had a new surprise the sound volume is very poor now lugging a wifi speaker along wherever the laptop goes i have to not recommend for this very reason absolute garbage i really do not write reviews but when i do i usually make them for the people this laptop is good when it works but i only used this about 10 times and now it does not charge or turn on pretty much got robbed i am really disappointed i was really hyped about this product but no durability whatsoever no scratch or anything looks brand new and it is a lemon buyers beware acer aspire 5 slim laptop 156 inches full hd computer stop working this month july 2021 i purchase this item in october 2020 as a christmas gift for my grandson unfortunately the computer has stop working and the battery will not charge please contact me in reference to the warranty information i would not purchase another computer through amazon no customer service support when needed bought this for my brother laid up with back surgeryeasy to work great graphics and definitely user friendly all ok so far cute unitbut does not work after two hours black screen deadmay i have a replacement unit i love this computer but the mouse pad does not work had to buy a wireless mouse to even use it but otherwise great product good quality use it to work from home and meetings and classed i faced several issues with this pc in spite on light usage first google meet does not work on all browsers and suddenly mutes the conversation we spent ages trying to solve this problem until we discovered that it works only on microsoft edgesound quality is not clear and lowfinally the battery stopped charging and the laptop does not work except when it is plugged in power all of this happened after less than 8 months of usagea total waste of money the product arrived with a bad wireless card i returned the item and the refund was applied to a amazon gift card instead of my credit card i am not happy i have had this computer for a year and for some reason the computer will not work unless it is plugged in i originally got it for college but the pandemic caused me to stay and do school at home i have not spilled anything or dropped the computer so i do not know what the problem is nice pc but the backlighting went out after 3 weeks and acer could not help me having a laptop without being able to see the keys is not good bought one year ago already falling apart lacks durability good for a few months then you will need a new one the input to the power cord is broken and now the laptop will not charge the lever that opens and closes the laptop pulled apart stay away terrible quality i baught this laptop and after just a month and a half the mouse pad will not work scam all else ok i regret buying this laptop and spending all the extra money in shippingi am having two major troubles with this laptop1 the laptop slows down and lags badly once unplugged from power it runs fast and fine when plugged it is so bad i have gone to control panel and under power settings created a different profile for high performance and gone to advanced power settings and set everything to high performance and still the issue persistsi upgraded the ram to 16gb same issue i have done countless troubleshooting as seen on different websites my windows is updated i have switched off most background and startup apps and it is still same i just do not understand why i cannot have the freedom to use my laptop at high performance when unplugged this is crazy i am suspecting amd and acer to be behind this this issue sometimes does not happen but most times it does2 second issue is that when connected to hotspot this device will from time to time shut off internet connection for not obvious reasonso i could be in the middle of an important zoom meeting and off she goesdo not buy this if you want peace of mind the back cover also is inferior plastic considering i had a toshiba laptop for over 10 years with no problems i expected better of this but two months into it the touch pad and cursor died fortunately i still had the wireless mouse and keyboard so the laptop is still functionali do not have the time or patience to fool around with a return when i buy a product i expect it to work we will see how long it lasts track pad broke within 1 month of use amazon was no help extremely happy with this i have a laptop i can take on the go for long business trips even upgraded the ram to make it even better glad i found this</td>\n",

purchase anyways…. and so far so good! Battery life is about 7 hours of constant use (games, videos, etc). Sounds is good. I had no problems connecting to internet. The border of the phone did appear to have some scratches but not too many., The phone I received has a loose charging port that should have been replaced. It was at 27% just now and I plugged it in and opened an app. Now it just gave me the under 20% notification so it’s obviously struggling to keep the cord in place., No working well can't download any apps horrible phone My old Android works better than this junk. Please refund money. Diana Manuele, It’s for personal and the battery life issues is crazy it’s only take 2 hours, Worked slow, barely charged., Battery life is not good at all. Only last an hour., The worse I never bought. Battery is dead and I sent it in Africa, so no way to return it. Just lost my money. I could give 0 star, I’m very picky with my phone cases which means I keep buying them until I find one that’s jut right. This phone case has everything I’m looking for. It’s not to bulky and has a slim fit. It’s enclosed and has a built in screen protector. The front plastic trim doesn’t cover top and bottom front of the Like some cases making the screen “appear” smaller.The rubber is stiff and durable and not like those cheap ones the stretch out over time.One reviewer stated they had to keep taking it apart to get the moister out. Well this is NOT a waterproof case and if it was it would be heavier and bulkier. I’m wondering how that much moister is getting in ther in the 1st place. Are you bathing with it? Tip: instead of drenching the phone with cleaning solution then wiping it up, try spraying the cleaning solution on the rag itself (just enough to coat it) then use that to clean the screen.Another reviewer stated the back falls off. If you don’t snap it in correctly this will happen. Solution: go to an arts and crafts store or fabric store and ask for some double sided hem tape. It’s very thin and extremely strong. It will keep that back on if it’s a defect., Phone broke a little after a month. Was only given a small % back on return and was never told why after multiple emails. Do not buy!!!!, Phone appeared to be flawless when it arrived. It stopped recognizing any sim card after 3 months. even though it was a few days out of warranty when it died the seller still took it back for a full refund., Too small in size, The phone looks great. However, the battery life was 70% instead of the promised 80%. This means that the battery dies very quickly, even when fully charged. We attempted to contact the seller but received no response. We would have settled for an exchange, but again, no response. Looks like we have to buy a battery, add another $50 to the price to get a fully refurbished phone. Very disappointed., Hey- it’s an iPhone. I did have to buy ear buds for this unit as none came with it.The phone is OK, but the battery is horrible., GSM does not work. This version of IPhone cannot be repaired. I stop being able to update, because it does not connect to the local network. It is WITHOUT SERVICE ... that is, now it helps me to connect only by wifi and to listen to music ... Battery drains from 100 to 0 in 2 hours of use  The battery is at 50%? I mean, impossible to use it. Lousy purchase They should withdraw it from circulation to these iPhone 7, Phone came in on 86 battery life and touch screen doesn’t like to work, wouldn’t recommend this phone., phone works great, but battery needs replacement, per the iPhone settings screen, just over 3 months after purchase. Does not hold charge for long even with all settings optimized, not using GPS in background etc. Otherwise price was reasonable., The phone battery was supposed to be at 80% or better but this battery only 77% and Apple saying need to replace battery now. It's too bad vendors don't install new batteries and increase the price because changing these batteries is not fun as you can have screen damage and broken wires. Aside from that very happy with phone and fast delivery., Good condition, but instantly overheats when charge. Not sure if that’s normal but the body of it great condition, This IPhone 7 gets really hot as soon as you charge it . Also it charges slow ,, The phone is unlocked no scratches , no flaws . Came right on clear. Packaged for fragile item very well. My daughter loves her new phone., It is hard to buy from a third party and it not working is frustrating., My review is half bad and half good. It came in almost a week, which I was crazy waiting for it. I was so happy when it got here! I checked the battery capacity and it only charges to 62, which was so disappointing. It charges really fast, but loses a lot of percent quick. Other than that everything was good. It came with a charger and charger block., I ordered from Trademore to get a refurbished iPhone 7, and it arrived fully ready to go out of the box with the latest iOS version installed. All I needed to do was add in my SIM chip and sign on with my Apple ID, and iCloud Backup restore did the rest. The unit I received works like new and was actually flat (as opposed to some other refurbs I've had); it had some scratching on the glass, but not over the actual display area. Trademore and Amazon refurbs may seemed more expensive than refurbs from elsewhere, but it's worth it for a great unit with no hassles or technical gotchas., It took a while for this to become an issue. At first I was restarting the phone which I thought was fixing the problem but the proximity sensor does not function properly. As a result, when I attempt to talk on a call, the screen remains lit and the side of my face continually hits the buttons, resulting in frustration for both me and the caller. It's impossible to hold a voice call at this point. Unfortunately, by the time I realized what the problem is, the phone isn't eligible for a refund., Easy to use, I got my iphone 7 opened it was fine owner didnt factor reset it i turned it on an it was on home screen.Works well i like it!! 8/10 😃, batter health was at 70 not the promised 80., Bad phones you are not honest, I bought this for a July gift.  It stopped working 8 months later.  It would no longer receive a cellular signal.  It took about a week to troubleshoot with the mobile carrier before they said it must be your phone.  I took it to a phone repair shop and they said the motherboard crashed. 😩, So I got this phone, when it originally came, it had more damage than what was listed so I returned it. The next one that came in had little to no damage so I was excited. However, after the 30 day return window (of course) the phone has been having all sorts of problems. I have audio issues with my phone on speaker, the keyboard gets stuck constantly, and the battery life is pretty much non-existent. Incredibly pissed I bought this for 230$ and now can only get 60$ if I sell it back. Just a warning, but if you buy your phone from here you are gambling with your money honestly. So just do a payment plan through your provider or get it from apple and spare yourself the frustration, Died every 20 minutes and constantly shut off and if it was colder than 50 degrees it would not turn on., I’m disappointed with this phone’s battery life. I have to make sure I keep a charger with me everywhere I go. This is my first experience with an iPhone so maybe that is how they are, I don’t know., This was in good condition and battery life good., Seller guarantees 80% battery. Received phone with battery capacity of only 75%. Seller never replied to follow up messages and only offered a $20 credit and never replied when alternatives were requested., Bought this refurbished iPhone for our daughter.  We like the parental controls that Apple offers.  We aren't going to buy her a new expensive phone so it is nice to get a used one from Amazon., Overall good product! The cameras kind of glitches at times but it overall works. The battery dies very quickly, but it works perfectly fine even without a sim card. Very good product!, I just got this  for my middle school son in time for school to start. It needed charging upon arrival, but the charging cord/plug that came with it did not work. Luckily this  is a replacement phone, and we have other chargers in the house and so were able to get it charged.It's working so far. I can't comment on battery life yet because it's too soon. The phone appeared to be in excellent condition., Overall satisfied with iPhone 7 transaction: the phone arrived in pristine physical condition--I could not find a scratch on it.The battery however had 78% capacity, not the 80% advertised. Not sure it would have made a difference as this phone was for my 12 year old son and in the end I decided to replace the battery (which granted is not for everyone as it's not a 5-minute process - more like an hour and 44 minutes process).Was able to successfully change the battery and all is well. So, net-net was able to get a like-new iPhone 7 for under $200.Recommend this vendor but do know if you are not comfortable swapping in a new battery you'll be charging your phone 2-3 times a day as normal phone usage will deplete the battery quickly., I like everything I don’t dislike nothing, Fine, I like is because it was a easy set up and everything was good on it, i have to go to apple because i got this phone for verizon and it wont let me make calls or texts sooooo basically dont buy it, I was pleasantly surprised after reading a few not-so-good reviews ... but the iphone 7 (Verizon) that I received looked like it was brand new.  It was packaged very nicely in a custom box with a new charging cable and AC converter.  Not a single scratch on it, \"battery health\" was rated at 84% and everything worked perfectly.  Frankly, I can't imagine why someone actually traded this in for a new phone????  But I'm glad they did.  My daughter (currently my Tech Support person) was sweet enough to get me a very nice \"Youmaker\" protector for it ... she knows I'm a bit clumsy.  I've only had this phone for a few weeks but so far so good.  I even use it for visual control (FPV) on a few of my quads/drones ... it is remarkable how well the battery holds up for that video on 10-15 minute flights ... much better than my old iphone.  Very glad I bought this., Runs slow , colabirtation is off and screen glitches, Battery life is insufficient and less than expected., Phone came fast and everything is good but the battery only holds a charge for about an hour when it’s not charging pretty annoyed about this., Bad battery life junk charger, just buy new instead of having to do it anyways, Home button non functional., Wasn't bad came in good condition., If I can fit everything I didn’t like about this phone into this box I would detail it.But whoever replaced the screen did a horrible jobWon’t register any SIM cards to any carrierIt looks like I bought it from wish.com, There’s a black line when trying to take pictures, takes horrible pictures, The phone is used and it doesn’t earphones, Everything was great. Like brand new!, Like many, read a lot of bad reviews... Was worried that there would be major issues upon getting the phone. HOWEVER, my phone showed up next day, SUPER FAST. Opened up the packaging and the iphone 7 looked very very good. Couple very tiny scuffs, but was expecting such as it is a USED phone would give it a 9/10 and i'm picky. Called my phone provider and they were able to switch it to my number no problem. I have sprint, which has merged with t mobile. I got the FULLY UNLOCKED phone, for anyone wondering. After running the phone through all its tests, everything is in proper working order. Battery life is at 84% which is fine by me. Higher than the stated number of 80% anyways. Never really payed attention to that stuff on the other phones i have had. All i can say is that the phone is doing everything it should and I am very happy with it. If there is one concern, the phone may be running a hair warm, but nothing to seem worried about momentarily. I will update this post at any point in the next 6 months if need be, but so far so good. COMPANY I WENT WITH: TECH EXCHANGEE NY, screen had a small crack and a chip  and the back has some marks on it and the home button is difficult to make contact. however the phone does work., Cord does not work!, This device only worked for 6 months and it started decaying. I send it to apple and they stated that it will need a new motherboard., This was for personal use the phone has been nothing but trouble since the day we got it. Will not make calls or will make calls on its own we don’t even when we’re not even trying. Need to know if there is insurance on this purchase Or is there any kind of warranty on this purchase, Item came without a charger, I have been using my phone for about a month, from what I have been able to assess so far the phone has been working properly, the battery holds fairly well, unless playing a game on the phone it drains the battery pretty quickly. The Siri function, the finger print unlock, and camera are pretty amazing, and they are some of the many things that I did not have on my iPhone 4...so this is a wonderful upgrade for me!, Very average product! Must have been used for couple of years before reselling it. Battery life was at 80% when arrived. Good purchase if one wants to buy iPhone at cheap price, Phone works great i have to say no problems so far 5/5, Have this phone just over six months it glitches, turns off all the time, battery drains fast, phone won't shut off even when the battery is at 98%.  The amount of money I spent on it I should have gotten more than 6 months use, wouldn't recommend., The phone  barley work can’t call nobody can’t text nobody, Why it dies so fast ?, It’s ok, It’s a good phone over all but often freezes or hangs up calls on its own. Dies very fast! Annoying., The stop working in 2 weeks, Extremely scratched and banged up. Shouldn't have passed quality control. Unless the standards are that low, Perfect condition, The battery on my other phone was only lasting me from 7 am - 1 pm so I figured I would get a new phone - The new phone is lasting from 7 am - 11am and says the battery is 100% healthy...., Worst purchase ever don't waste time on this item does not even turn on turns mad hot 1st day on arrival does not turn on 2nd day return hopefully all turn out good with money back update later on, Phone has no signal, Antenna broke internally on phone within 4 months just outside the 3 month return window.  Worked great until then., i liked it except for the fact that the back had some dints in it and u can’t turn it on silent mood, Look good, Speaker are not working, Arrived a day early which is usually nice, but I planned my schedule around it arriving on the estimated delivery date. It had obvious wear on the back and there was a small blotch on the screen that must've been dead pixels or something because it was pure white regardless of what was on the screen. I didn't like it in this condition, so I returned it and they said they would deduct return shipping cost from my refund but they ended up not doing that., The phone I received did not have a working microphone. Couldn’t record or make calls. The company issued me a full refund. They have great customer service but sold a faulty device so I gave a neutral rating., Honestly I was so nervous to buy a phone from Amazon for the 7 year old stepson ... but reviews can be very deceiving .. phone worked GREAT !! Now if I can only get this 7 year old to come back to earth and stay off the phone lol needles to say he loves it ..., The phone doesn’t work. I can hear a person I call, but they can’t hear me., I loved this phone for about a half a year and loved it! However, I got a message saying my SIM card could not be read. Turns out that this is a known iPhone mistake when iPhones are built. When I brought it to the Apple store they said that because it was originally made in Japan they could not fix it or send me a new one. I am now out for a new phone. However it worked very well when it did, I just wouldn’t risk it., My battery dies way too soon. The package also arrived much later than expected and also had a decent scratch in the screen deep enough to affect the overall appearance. The camera works just as expected but it definitely was not the “new” look you can definitely see the precious wear and tear on the iphone., No work for Verizon, Great phone thank you, i was confused by the packet  i received with item, it said iphone 5s - i was ready to return(im a new iphone user) i was kinda disappointed with charger not working - had to buy additional one to use phone - overall its a great item -, The phone was very nice looking phone, but I had to return the  phone due to it was not compatible with my sprint network service., The phone constantly restarts itself. The battery lasts all of 10 minutes. I do not recommend buying a phone from this company.. they’re junk., I've only had this Iphone 7 a few days. The reason I bought it is because my previous Iphone wouldn't hold a charge for more than a few hours. So far this Iphone will hold a charge for 2 days with moderate use. I'm happy with it so far. The charger that came with it did not work but I still have my previous Iphone charger that did work. Other than that I am happy with it. It didn't have any scratches or anything and looks brand new., This review is for the seller Hybrid IT. First of all, I wasn’t expecting it to come as fast as it did. I ordered my phone Friday at 3 AM and received it Saturday by 12 PM, that’s kind of insane since they are in NY and i’m in FL. There are a few small scuffs on the bottom of the device near the speaker but otherwise it’s pretty close to perfect cosmetically. The screen has no scratches at all, i can’t tell if it’s the original but if it was replaced they did a hell of a job. The max battery capacity is 100%. it came with a charger but no headphones or headphone adapter so you will need to buy one. i haven’t experienced any issues so far but it’s only been a day so i will make sure to come back and give an update.Also if you have Metro by TMobile and you’re having trouble getting service after inserting your SIM, you have to register the phone with them before it will work, not sure about other carriers. for a second i thought i received a locked/stolen phone but i wanted to make sure. don’t give up unless the carrier actually tells you it won’t work. you can try calling the customer service number and doing it with the automated system or a representative but if you don’t have access to your old phone you need to go into the store. It took 5 minutes and only costs $15-20 depending on where you live.Overall i’m extremely pleased, it was a risk but i’m happy i seem to have gotten a good device. Thankful for all the reviews recommending to buy from this seller., The maximum capacity of the battery was on 74% when I received the phone. I can only use the phone for a few hours before the battery is completely dead. Other than them sending it with a bad battery the phone works great., DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!! I got this in today after looking for a good phone for my son for about 2 months the home button didn't work and you can't use Verizon it is not Amazon renewed its a scam, Phone is ok, no marks or scratches, but came with outdated ios that needed to be updated prior to transferring data from old phone.  Battery life isn't great., There are times when a phone is set to support another carrier, and even after a full factory reset, any carrier update will kill your mobile network.  Happened to me.  Sprint/T-mobile reset it and tried multiple times, and every time we got it to work, it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a day.That means no calls, no text, no internet if you're outside of wifi.Be warned and keep your old phone handy.  You may be disappointed like i was., Every renewed phone I’ve gotten before this one had a renewed battery. This one did not. Will have to get one soon, phone charge only last a few hours. Would not have bought it if I would have known the battery was not renewed., ok, It was good phone till a month after purchase kinda salty about it still wish i didnt spend on the phone also did not come with the right charger, I like the condition of the phone. It really looks as good as new.The problem is on the earphones plug. Should provide the adapter., The phone was ok. I had a few issues but nothing major., Gof a great product. Fast response, Phone worked great for about 6 months. Then it stopped connecting to the cellular service. Trying to update it and the phone says that I can’t. Called Apple support and they can’t do anything since phone is no longer under warranty., Everything was good except the battery came to me at 80% capacity.  So when it charges to 💯 it’s never better than 80%.  The seller offered me a 20.00 credit but I can’t find an authorized dealer to change the battery.  🤷‍♀️, This phone is almost perfect!!! The only thing about this device is that I can’t get it turned on due to the fact that it won’t accept a SIM card. I found this misleading due to the fact that they told me my device was renewed and compatible with certain carriers., Nice piece, My son loves it. Arrived quick, looks new, & works great! He’s been smiling since, Received the phone in the usual blank white box refurbs come in, shipping was fast and it came with an android charger block and a no name lightning cable.Phone came with one long deep scratch, a cracked home button, and a couple other much smaller nicks and scratches, enough that it was off putting for me. Battery life showed 92% which is excellent however the phone did seem to lag after only my second week with it.Phone was unlocked as stated and I had no issues switching in my sim and using the phone right away. Overall a decent phone but I will be returning it because of the the cracked Touch ID button and deep scratches, The phone does not work properly it heats up so hot every time we try and use it ., Gift good condtion, A good way to get a new iPhone at a good price, The battery is useless, it takes 3 hours of use to fully recharge, needs to be replaced, All seemed as expected from the seller and from description except battery life was not 80% or above as stated in listing but 70%.The biggest issue with this was having to pay, send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promised.This just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending, then what else are they not checking with these phones., Didn’t come with any kind of paperwork and it’s working but the touchscreen can freeze up at times., Although i was very happy to get a much needed upgrade from my old 5s and this was just the right size there were a couple of things i was not satisfied with and almost sent the phone back. First of all Amazon stated the battery would be able to be charged at a minimum of 80% its original capacity mine was not it was around 75% i figured ok well i suppose i could live with that but amazon also states that there will be no visible blemishes on the phone viewed from 12 inches that was not the case with mine the finish on one of the rear corners about a half inch the entire corner of the phone was completely wore off once again i decided I could live with that since it is the rear and would be covered with the case. Overall im happy with the speed and functionality of the phone though and the screen camera and everything work great. I’m not happy that i will end up putting another 50 to 100 dollars into a phone that cost me about 200 in order to get a new full capacity battery that lasts longer for media and extended use, Daughter loves it, No fingerprints reader and the phone Glitches a lot, I was switching phones because the one I was using had a battery that was starting to die. However this one does just as quickly and got so hot it almost hurt to hold it., I just opened this product and charged it fully for two hours and unplugged it. As I’m sitting here on my old phone to port over my SIM card credentials, the battery went from 100 to 88% within 8 minutes. I just saw the numbers dropping right before my eyes. The phone transfer and condition are really good but the battery is terrible. I wish the guarantee included a new battery. (Health is reading at 83% out of the box)., The phone is very small., BATTERY LIFE NOT AS ADVERTISED  ONLY 56%NO ANSWER FROM SELLER, The phone looked good function well but was defective it had something loose inside and I had return it, I’d definitely buy again. This the real deal fr. Y’all should try them out! I got my money’s worth ., The battery life last about 2 to 3 hours., Great phone, defiantly recommend. It’s a little weird at times like it takes a while to turn on after it dies sometimes and I can’t have certain pictures as my screensaver for some reason. It would black out parts of it but I only had that problem with two of my pictures. Other than that for a refurbished phone it’s pretty good., I've boughten iPhones from amazon before, two different iPhone 6s. This time, I could only find iPhone 7, so if figured \"why not?\". I'll tell you why, this seller sent a defective phone. It worked perfectly the first day, and then 24 hours later it told me I needed to update it or else my cellular data wouldn't work (which means I could not receive or send any texts or calls!). Sure enough, I updated it, and it worked, for another few hours, until it said it needed ANOTHER UPDATE! Unfortunately, it was already up to date as it could be. So I took it in to the \"geniuses\" at APPLE, and they said THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH iPhone 7, YOU NEED TO REPLACE IT. And that was it. Returning, hopefully that goes smoothly. Avoid iPhone 7, too sketchy., excellent product   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It’s thick, but works good once you get used to it!, These base and top coats work great for an at home gel mani-pedi. My only issue was when i tried to soak and scrape it off, it seemed like the base layer bonded almost TOO well with my nail, and part of my nail layers scraped off. I had to take a few months break between the next gel manicure because my nails were damaged. This could just be user error or the fact that my nails are extremely thin. They held up great though, and looked beautiful., the product works great, the only reason i didn’t give five stars was because it smells TERRIBLE. like a skunk almost and it’s very strong. but it works, and works well., I would buy it again. Beats having to use nail polish remover in the end. Best quality I’ve ever used at home. Nails come out looking professional. Very easy to use. I recommend it., smells awful, While the polish is great, every bottle I've ever had from them, 4, ALL HAVE LEAKED when on their side., I love this product it’s very easy and it last for 14 days, Best brand for top coat and base!! My favorite one, Terrible product. The base coat seemed to work fine, but the top coat was in such a gel-like consistency that I couldn't even use it. No matter how hard I shook the bottle up, it remained the same. Waste of money. Only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the base coat worked. All in all, NOT HAPPY!!!, The base coat is horrible. You’re better off just buying the top coat only. Top coat is average I would say. I’ve done my manicures without the base and they come out better. The base causes the polish to look bumpy., Really cool that I can do this at home. Just light and done!, My top coat bottle came completely empty. I am returning for a replacement but it’s disappointing!, Poor quality, was only good the first few uses. Base coat became thick and does not go on smoothly at all. Product quality changes over very short time. Would not recommend. Both me and my sister are allergic to this product. After some use it causes nail bed pain and inflammation., It's great that you take a picture... but it helps if you show the door # !!! This was dropped off at 104!? NOT 106, I could not get the base coat to dry fully.  I used my UV light 5 times (5 min) and it was still tacky.  I gave up and went ahead and put polish over it anyway.  The polish I used thankfully was able to dry just fine.  The top coat seemed to dry much better but I won't be using this brand again., Overall this is a good set. It can be thick so be sure to wipe the brush on the side of the bottle before applying and when covering your nail. Make sure to use thinner coats and apply evenly or else you’ll see the lines/uneven levels after curing.For curing times, I have a UV LED lamp and wasn’t sure how long to cure for. Top coat 60 seconds is perfect. Cures hard and comes off easily when time to remove. For base coat I tried 60 seconds but was having a hard time when removing it, so I went down to 30 seconds and that seems to have helped., Top coat dried out in the bottle after 3 uses. Returned!, Perfect, Bottles came leaking from the top. The gel polish I got to go along with these two bottles was perfectly fine and intact. Why these leaked I don’t know. I haven’t used them yet either since most of the product was all over the box it came in., Top coat goes on nicely and leaves a nice shinny coat and is not sticky., Pretty easy to come because the polish came off within a week. I would have expected it to last at least 2 weeks., Very small but not too bad, Nice, not that good, This product worked amazingly well. After a minute under LED /UV it was dry. Very sheer and worked well with my polygel kit., First time trying this brand and my last. Very, very thin like a refusal polish, not hard at all. Nails broke easily. I do not recommend this brand., Great product, Amazing! Lasts the longest out of anything I’ve tried!, This is a peel off formula. I do follow all the instructions for application and I never use acetone to remove. I soak in water for a few minutes or just hand wash some dishes and I am able to peel of the polish most times I one piece. Now while that its awesome because it removes easily, the manicure does not last past 2 days with out major chipping., I used it the first time and it worked real good! but the second time was horrible, I could not get it to set correctly, it was in a way clumpy? it sucks because I really wanted to like it., Horrible product. Does not stay on. The top coat has a thick glue like consistency and does not spread on nail well. Peels off within a couple of days. So disappointed., Is just a oil, It is clumpy and didn’t even dry all the way through, now my nails are smudged.Está muy gruesa y no se secaron bien mis uñas., I ordered the base & top coat about 4 years ago & I loved it. I started doing my own nails again so I wanted to try it again...bad idea. The base coat works fine but the top coat started clumping & was too thick & this was only the first use. Maybe they’ve changed the polish since the last time I used it but I won’t be ordering it again., Works fine doesn’t last too long though., The base coat good, but the top coat is trash! Starts peeling the next day., Great base and tip coat!! Lasts atleast 3 weeks for me!!, Not even an Ounce, I have tried various steps in an effort to get this polish to last longer than 7 days. It doesn't matter what I do it chips and looks like crap and has to be changed by day 7. I bought this base and top with Amelie gel polish., The topcoat got extremely clumpy after the second use causing an unsmooth finish., I was super excited to get my gel polishes in with such fantastic ratings- unfortunately the product was so thick when i went to apply, it applied like a literal paste.  There is no good use for this polish and I would like a refund promptly., I love the no wipe too coat. Saves me some time., This brand doesn’t hold up, the shellac peels off a lot sooner then expected., seriously soooo good! i do my own gel nails/toes at home and this is by far the best set i’ve gotten. gel polish is definitely an art and takes a long time to master - if this set “lifts” you probably just aren’t doing your gel application correctly. these two are excellent! also added bonus you don’t need to wipe the top coat :), The item itself is good but the bottles are very very tiny. I wish they made them a little bigger for the price., This does what it says it will do and the top coat is not sticky at all when it sets. The only complaint I have is that if you try to close the bottle when there is polish on the brush and the polish gets onto the mouth of the bottle, the cap will actually shrink wrap onto the mouth of the bottle making it very hard to open! This has happened to me several times so now I make sure there is no polish on the outside of the mouth of the bottle and I try to close it very gently not tightly. Please be aware of how you close this nail polish otherwise it will take FOREVER TO OPEN when you want to use it again., I really loved this product for the first few months! But recently began to have an allergic reaction to the product! I'm bummed I have to switch it up now because its great quality. Not saying don't buy it-- but definitely be mindful!, Very good product. Will buy again., applies and cures well, but dulls your manicure significantly. Also the base coat is difficult to remove., Bought for my sister who does nails and she didn’t like it... sadly, I like the product it’s a good shine and it lasts about two weeks I was pleased., The gel has a murky purple coating during the day time. It glows green under UV light.  When comparing this top coat to my Kupa inc Top coat there is a huge difference in color. Kupa inc top coat is clear and the Aimeli has the Murky Purple coating., So in love with this gel. It is thick and gets into all the nooks and crannies. It was actually recommended by a nail tech on you tube (nailed by nikki) and I had to try.  So far I am loving this product!!! If you don't like thick gel this is not for you but trudt you won't regret this buy., Top coat does not wear well. Base coat works great!, Dislike, Great base and top coat for gel nails, Not bad I've ordered it several times wish they would sell a matte top gel with these too, I was scared at first because it Was still tacky after curing under UV light but I read it’s supposed to be so polish will stick. Continued with my nail routine and it turned out well! Really great product especially for the price!!, Great for beginners. Works well, I brought the polish the size of the bottle for what you pay is pretty small I don’t blink your eyes, This chips and peels off, about like regular nail polish.  It is nothing like \"gel nails\" that you get in the salon, which is what I was looking for., Top coat turns yellow after a few days. I have used the base and top coat 4 times so far, and every time my nails start turning yellow after a few days. I have tried different curing times and even wiped the top coat after, but nothing seems to fix it. This has never happened with other brands of gel top coat I have used., Worked pretty good, good product for the price ! I usually get opi but this did the job, This was great for the price. Only issue was it did chip in some nails but that may have been true to operator error, I may not have cured the polish long enough. All in all I’m happy with my purchase. Also, arrived a lot sooner than I had anticipated., This! I can’t even begin! This is an amazing base and top coat my nails lasted! It was easy to use, and great for gels!I love it, This is my first gel base and top coat so I really don't have anything to compare it to., This must be a cheaper brand or the base coat is just bad. I have been using file off gel polish and I was noticing that I have a problem not damaging my nail when filing it off. It wasn't killing my nails, but I figured soak off would case me to do less accidental damage.I bought this brand because it was prime available and somewhat inexpensive. In a week I have had two nails (one on each hand) peel completely off. Its not like the free edge got loose. It just was really lifted in the middle or edge where it frowns in, and the loose polish would get peeled up to an awkward place where I had to remove it or it would peel even more off the top layer of my nails. One happened in just 3 days. THREE DAYS. I fixed those two jankity nails and I also added a second coat of just the top coat to all of my nails after 1 week. I can't tell if the top coat is better or not.Now this does have a perk. Its super easy to soak off and remove. Like wow it removes like butter. But, if its coming off super easy because it falls off of a well prepped nail in less than a week, this is a problem. I can now see why this has some lower ratings and why people would spend at least double on a widely known US name brand. Will I use the rest of teh bottle? Yes. I am cheap! I also like changing my nail polish color frequently if I can pull that off. This soaks off so easy that I could totally change my polish all the time. But, it also just falls off which means when I am too busy to do a manicure once a week this just flat out sucks.Edit: I have updated this review because after sitting and soaking off the polish I am really happy with how my nails look. They aren't damaged or sad looking. It really did just bubble up and off. This wouldn't be my choice for wearing before going on vacation or trying to wear for weeks in a row since it doesn't bubble up and come off easily, but if you like to change your nail color a couple of times a week you will be happy with this polish.8/8 Update: I keep trying this base/top coat FOOLISHLY because I have it. It keeps performing poorly. Polish just pops off within a day or two of application.  Just spend more and get Gelish. Even with shrinkage at least it stays on the nail better. Its my own fault for trying it again, but good grief., Peels easy, This basecoat is whack. Upon applying it, it’s separated like crazy. When I applied my gel color over top it also would separate on top until the second or third layer when it evened out. The topcoat is great, not tacky once it’s been cured and works as advertised., Top coat and base coat is very thick hard to apply thin.  Took forever to cure and was sticky had to put under the led light a lot longer than suggested to cure and then my thumb completely peeled off, This is the worst gel I've ever used. Doesnt really fully harden.  Peels off. Not durable at all. Do not reccommend!!, Not good dont buy this, This item is a great price for the two bottles. And it a product that I like because of the no wipe top coat, and it give a nice shiny finish., Easy to use and has a nice longevity! Impressed with the quality., Not so well, I used this base and top coat with the Gellen polish brand. This stuff works great- top coat is very glossy and dries fast with the UV lamp. Like instantly dry. I’ve had these nails for 2 weeks and the gloss wore off a smidge but that’s expected after 2 weeks. Still hasn’t chipped or lost ALL glossiness. I recommended this brand to 2 friends. Overall great purchase! I will be buying the colors next., I am reasonably new to gel nails and this was my first set of top and base, which I bought as Amazon reccommended it. I am fully aware of how long it takes to remove gel, but this stuff DOES NOT COME OFF. An hour of working at it every manicure with sandpaper, bowls of acetone, and wraps, and it just does not budge. Yet, it manages to lift along my cuticle line after a week and a half. Buy something higher quality and experiment with inexpensive gel colors. Lesson learned., I do like this but do not get to close to the sides of your nail. It will peel up. I can get it to last 7 to 10 days so I guess it's not to bad. Its not easy to take off unless it is peeling up. I am by no means a pro with my nails so it could totally be something that I am doing wrong but for the price it's not a bad product., Great quality for the price. Convenient that you don’t have to use rubbing alcohol after use. My nails stay on really well using the base and top coat. Used with uv light., look nice but the nail polish only last like 4 days., Liked this product and the cost is fair. I have used name brands that have cost more and this brand is equivalent., Bottles were broken at the cap. Bottles spilled out the contents. Was not able to be used. Very disappointed, This is my favorite base & top coat set. I definitely wish that they made bigger bottles or maybe a refill bottle because I literally have to order a new set every week. I go through them too quickly and having the option to just refill my bottle would be so amazing., I really like this base/ top coat but it does leave almost a blue tint to the polish sometimes or it can be streaky., I am new to the DIY UV lamp. This is a must have for UV gel! Make sure your nails are clean and dry before you put the base coat (wiping with alcohol works well). Would recommend and buy again, Not a big fan of this. The base coat never dries (which I know is kind of okay cause it's a base coat) but overall it just takes forever under the lamp. And by that time things like dust get stuck in the polish so it's weird., Was old, Really smooth and shiny but it has a really strong smell, Bought for a friend and she said it's the best she's used this far. I'll stick to the Beetles brand but it's good to know there's an alternative that works well if necessary., good, This top coat sucks. It gets so cloudy and it doesn’t shine, I bought this as my first gel base and top coat. Polish lasted the average two week which was great. However, no matter how careful I applied it, it always left imperfections. Like it shrinks when it sets up under the light. Perfect and smooth going on. Ripples when dried. I tried it with many different colors/brands and always got the same result. I will stick to my new favorite CNC Shellac. Perfect every time, Used it twice. By the second time, the product had already become a useless gooey substance.Waste of money., I work whole day and full time mom and this works great lasts 10 days!, Easy to apply, Received today and not sure if this is oldProduct but I can’t get the top coat bottle open not sure but it’s definitely defective, You NEED the no wipe top for any of their polishes., I use plenty top coat but this is the worst by far, Works great., Pretty nice polish., After using this product as instructed I realized that the topcoat comes off way too easy. I am not happy with it. I do like the builder gel but other than that I do not like this product, My base coat takes a longer time to dry other than that will by again, Love the colors but peels off ez on natural nails, This set is really nice and works well for acrylic nails. Be warned that on natural nails the top coat burns when cured. Otherwise this product is awesome., Trash !!, I love the base and top coat the only problem I’ve had is that the top coat came really lumpy but I’ve been working through it and just wiping the clumps off as I work. But over all they’re both great and last., i love how it goes on----i got so excited i ordered more----but it chips after a few days---am so very disappointed in that---would not buy again----now that i already have!!!, bought it as a result of all them better tthan positive reviews, i was not at all disappointed! definitely recommended with no reservations!, Long lasting, but a few cons. The product is very runny so you have to be careful, otherwise you'll have a lot of clean up around your cuticles to do before curing. I didn't have issues with peeling or chipping until a couple weeks later, so that's a plus. The biggest con for me was the removal. I'm not sure this is really \"soak off\". I soak cotton balls in 100% pure acetone and wrap in foil. After 40 minutes, only the top coat budged.... A little. My gel polish, another brand, peeled off very easily, but underneath the base coat was hard as a rock. This is the same thing that happens when I use my regular gel polish top coat and forget that it has to filed off and accidentally soak them., I love a good base and top coat but I do not want it to be so thick. This product is much thicker than any I have used so far and I had a lot of bubbling on my nail and for these reasons I am passing on future purchases., I've been using these for years. Seems like the formula changed lately. Less shiny, doesn't have the same look under the LED light. Not sure how it will hold up., Top coat was clumpy. Purchased 2 x happened to both top coats, The top coat was not going on well.  I had to replace the top coat with a different brand but I still use the base coat, The base coat works quite well (difficult to remove it though), but after 1 or 2 uses the top coat doesn’t work very well at all. It bubbles like crazy leaving a polka dot texture,  and my nails start chipping after 4 or 5 days of wear. Would not recommend., Functionally decent. They smell atrocious though, more so than any nail product I've smelled in my life. Acrylic smells better than this stuff, it's like burning plastic straight from the bottle. Needs over 60 seconds under UV to set but that's not a huge deal., I don’t know what I’ve been doing wrong, if anything, but the base coat cures in a weird way. It will almost bubble and shrink to one side of my nail. I thought it was my technique or lamp, but I later found out it wasn’t the case. The top coat is pretty solid though, so I’ll keep using that., I was so excited about finding a cheaper alternative to the Sally Hansen brand - but the first time I stuck my hands in any water, the top coat chipped right off and looked awful. Also took a long time to cure., It's cheap, but you should probably just pay a bit more for a better top coat., Nice gel. As expected., Applies well, dries well with my lamp, is no wipe. My only complaint is that it doesn't get thick or strong enough., This product works for maybe a day or 2 but after that it peels off or chips easily. So with that being said it definitely easy to remove lol. Would recommend just spending the money on a better product that might cost more. You will save yourself time!, I've had these for some time now. I do prefer this formula over other brands, HOWEVER, after using for a while, the outside of the bottles gets extremely sticky. There is still plenty of polish left over in the bottle, so I hate to throw it away, but I might have to replace them because I can't stand the feeling. Other than that, everything is great. Just make sure that you keep them upright all the time and be careful when using., This is amazing product., Love this product works great cures in 30secs. Would recommend 2 anyone who wants stronger lasting 💅 nails, Polish started chipping on day 1. To be fair, it may have been the UV lamp I was using because I think it was defective; hence the extra 2 stars., I love that you don't have to wipe the topcoat, but no matter how long I soak my nails… The basecoat will not come off! I have excellent soak off fingernail  polish remover, But the basecoat will not come off  all of the way . I'm going to have to sand it off my nails., Wow! This stuff lasts a very long time, however it took me 3 separate times of soaking my nails with acetone to remove the top coat at 20 minutes each time. I buffed my nails first to scratch it too. It might be easier to let the polish grow out! The top coat polish keeps its shine for entire time. This stuff lasts a long time.The base coat didn't even come off, so I just buffed it off with my nail file.I want to give this a great review, the price is so good, it's just so darn hard to remove. I like the other polish colors, but just will use my other brand base and top coats instead., Polish was awful, it was thick and difficult to apply because it didn’t flow from the brush...it globbed. I did use the curing light-thinking it might kind of smooth out a bit??  and it took 4-5 mins  (supposed to take ONE minute!!)  to make it “seem” ok but it never did completely dry. HUGE waste of my money and my time, The top coat is amazing! I love it. The base coat is weird (minus a star).  You have to put a super EVEN coat on the whole nail and it can’t be too thin of a layer because it becomes uneven. You have to use just the right amount. Anyway, it makes me wonder if the base coat is even necessary. Also, the base coat doesn’t dry hard after the lamp. It’s a bit sticky so don’t touch it. That’s supposedly normal though., I have mixed feelings about this product. The first time I  used the polish it was amazing!! But the next time I used it it was like the top coat was setting/hardening on the brush. I pulled that clump off and then went on it worked just as the first time. But then when I go to use it the 3rd time there is little hard pieces all over the brush. The was no sticky film once you cure it under the light. I just wish I for more uses out of it rather than looking like 3... I've used many gel polishes but this is the first to do this. I may have gotten a bad batch or something. I really like the base coat I have had no problem with the my polish coming off of my nail., Sticky, very sticky, I don’t feel like it is quite as shiney  as previous ones I have purchased, Pretty good.  Once dry there are no problems with chipping or peeling.  But need to take extra time under the UV lamp.  I've used two different brand lamps and both take a while to dry.  So, be patient and you have a great polish., I've used several different base and top coats but when I used this one it started peeling off after 3 days. Nice shine but that's a bummer., Doesnt stay on., Really shiny, easy to use, but for some reasons, it turns yellow after a couple days (3-4)., I've been sandwhiching my my old polish with great success. Lasts over a week, I haven't waited for it to chip to remove.I don't notice any funky smell like other reviewers.I have to say though, the base coat is difficult to remove. I have to do a second round of buffing and soaking to get it off, and still have to buff of the remnants.PS. You have to let your nail polish dry before you put on the top coat or it will never dry!, Will buy again, Leaked everywhere. Such a mess. Had to throwaway., VERY disappointed in this product. I have used a better top and base coat in the past and repurchased those instead. I missed the cut off to return it, but I honestly would. It didn’t last more than a week!, This base coat was unbelievably bad.  It applied smoothly (to freshly washed & cleaned nails that had been wiped clean of residue with alcohol), then as it cured it drew together into raised rivulets, leaving other parts of the nails completely bare. It also went spiky, with little points all over it that gave it a texture like there was sand mixed in. Needless to say, this did not provide a smooth canvas for my manicure, and when two coats of gel polish over it still couldn’t completely smooth it out, my only choice was to put a glitter overcoat over everything to camouflage it. So unimpressed!, Love ,love ,love. Very easy to apply and the topcoat is amazing. Week 3 and no chips on my nails. I have tried many other products,  but this is the BEST.  Highly recommend., TerribleQuality, make sure you are sober when you put it on the first. it's more difficult than regular polish, but it is 100% worth it,  very great colors and it last a lot longer., Base is not good. Top coat does cure pretty quickly but they really don't help the gel stay on longer as my gel chipped the next day. Was pretty annoyed at that., Good quality, very shiny but to little of product, I am glad I bought these but the top coat has been leaking a bit out of the top so it won’t last as long as I’d like but I still am pretty glad I bought it! And the price isn’t bad either!, I love this brand these are amazing, Unlike some name brand's, this product is too soft and allows your nails to tear. And peels off way too easy., It's ok I trying better that keep your nail polish on. More two day sad I have to do my nails very two days cause of product isn't good. Not worth the money., Excellent base & top coat. Makes my nails really shiny and hard and my polish last for 2+ weeks. But it does seem to dent if you push your nail or something sharp into it and for that I’m removing one start. Removal is easy too with a 180 grit file., I gave it 2 star's because the base coat get hard at all so I order a different kind I hope it works better, Bad quality, I use gel polish that does not require a base coat, so I only use the top coat. It dries down nice and hard and does not have a sticky finish. My biggest complaint is that the top coat almost separates, and does not provide an even finish. Does the job, for the most part.   \n",

Also the app that was suggested to use my phone as a remote for it did not work properly., Biggest pain to attach to a helmet. But works well otherwise., the only thing about the camera was that i had no clue it was so small., We enjoy using this camera to get a canine view of our dogs' activities! It fits well into their harness and we get to see them running, swimming, and playing. There are a large number of function and features, so reading the instructions is a must, especially to take full advantage of the power of this camera. It holds up well to use, we've had no problems with it in several months. Would definitely purchase again!, Not a good purchase, This camera works as advertised and video quality is more than I expected. Great features for the price. The adhesive in some of the mounts could be better. I wish they had special mount for ski helmets., This is a 12 megapixel camera with 4K video. Waterproof case is good and numerous attachments for mounts are included. Photo quality is less than average compared to my iPhone 6s and I can not get videos to play at all. Overall I would spend a few extra dollars and buy a better platform to capture life with., I bought this as a gift for my son, we haven't had a chance to use it just yet. The only issue I've had was inserting the SD memory card. Something seemed to be wrong with the slot. It wouldn't stay inserted all the way in, it seemed it was engaged like it already had a card in the slot. After some time I did manage to get it in correctly. We did do a practice video and took a picture, it has nice quality. We cant wait until the weather warms more to try it out., Bought this for my 9 year old son several months ago. It has been great. Glad we bought it. High quality for the reasonable price and a tough little camera.  It’s holding up well! No negatives I can think of. Works well with phone app. Glad I didn’t spend the extra money for GP. No need. This thing does it all. Lots of videos on YouTube comparing the two. See for yourself., Does not always stay on.I use it as a dash camera., The WIFI system sucks on this camera and the app it requires you to use keep crashing. I found another use for the camera but I would never by this camera again., I love this camera, works wonders for dirt bike trail riding and capturing sea life under water!, Product shipped fast, seems like a great camera so far just recently started using so not sure how to rate long term  yet., Audio doesn't pick up well in the protective case but the video is great. We're still learning to use it but the grandkids have fun recording things., I got this for my husband for a gift, the app didn't seem to work well with his Motorola phone, sinking issues and gave up on it. He has recently uodated to a new Samsung Galaxy 10, so hopefully will be able to get it to work w/it., Good price but takes terrible videos. It’s not worth the time to even save these videos. Look at the videos on the feedback, I don’t know why people think this is a good camera. Don’t waste your time., Very difficult to figure out what parts go to what and what they are used for. If you give them a good review they’ll give you another accessory that you’ll have no idea how to use. NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL INCLUDED. I guess you get what you pay for. I should have checked YouTube before purchasing this. Got it today, returning tomorrow., So far I'm impressed with this product. One things for sure no matter what u plan on mounting it to there's an accessory included to do so. I've only had it for a day but so far so good., doesn’t upload to your computer. Hard to work, This little cam is really good i went to the Bahamas last week and took many under water videos and photos and this camera work like a dream just remember to put in a high speed micro SD card (not included)., I absolutely love this and i have recommended it to all of my friends. I would definitely purchase this again. Thank you, No way that this is 12MP. No. Way! Also (and this was the main reason why I returned it)), the batteries lasted less than half an hour on a full charge. And, for some reason, the only way I could have turned on the camera was if I removed the battery from its compartment and re-insert it., Product works very well.  I use it for fishing and nature hikes. Taking videos hands free is a big advantage. I was impressed with all of the attachment accessories.Excellent value., While the picture is great, it appears that you have to set the date and time every time you change the battery. I haven't found anything in the manual that will save the date and time permanently which is unacceptable. Well I just found it #11. It says \"if you replace the battery, date and time will reset\". WT???????, Disappointing didn’t even work for 30mins in the water and stop working. Don’t waste your money!!!, UPDATED review:(SUPPORT to the Win) After seeing this review, the manufacturer emailed me back, and sent me 2 new batteries no charge, and both were timed by filming a clock, (lol) and both did about 2hrs of run time, of course i ran this once on each. Once summer comes i will pull out the helmet cam and go riding and push the camera to the limit. Advice, be sure to keep the camera outside of the waterpoof case if your riding in the heat, it gets hot with those batteries. Thanks Akaso for the follow upOriginal Review:I purchased this for my mtn bike rides and well it works nice but if you like having to try and time yourself on the trail and at 20 min per battery and only have 2 batteries than well, go for it, its a nice toy. Otherwise ya pay for what you get., The quality of the camera is about what you would expect for $60. It works exceptionally well in brightly lit areas like the outdoors and it also has a wide variety of attachments that make it great for whatever activity you plan on documenting such as hiking, water sports or skating.It's a great entry camera for people who are interested in getting involved with filmography., So I bought this item last year for a Xmas gift, and we are now just being able to use it. And the cord doesn't charge the battery, Works great for its price as well as wrist watch works with Simonides cameras as well great product great battery life, Lots of ways to use this camera. Ordered this thinking it would b great to b able to video our hunting dogs.  We were surprise at all the features it offered.  Must download the instructions and read carefully in order to get the best use from camera., Gave to grandchild.  Loves to show what he does., Wouldn't work for half my trip bought a memory card for it that was ment for the device, kept saying card in valid,battery's lasted about an 1hr, Have not had a chance to give a performance test of it. The box ship in was way to small for the item and it could have (lucky it did not) get damaged. So right now only can say packaging was not good. Will see later this week if camera is any good., It seems like a good camera. I have only used it in the pool so far.  I won't do scuba diving with it until June.The instructins are VERY lacking so it makes it much harder to figure out how to use.Also, I thought it had WAY to many extra parts that I will NEVER use., Very very, complicated. It will take a while to figure out., After opening the box and trying to figure it all out with no so hot directions and diagrams, I gave up and gave it to a friend's son who has more experience with the tech.  So many pieces and it was just not worth it for me.  I never even got it working so I can't judge the camera at all.  So, if you are into high tech camera stuff, it might be great, average user, not so much., It's not a bad unit if you're not willing to spend the money on the higher quality cameras. Bought it for hunting but it's hard to use in a pinch., No comparison to the GoPro.Not many features. No zooming capabilities. I guess you get what you pay for.Update: since posting the above I was contacted by Akaso and offered a partial refund which I received immediately once I agreed to it. Very good customer service., Camera shoots video really well for the price, however the app that goes with it is garbage, This is a good value camera we use for family events. Great price for an action cam, It's a solid camera pictures are ok. But, they look better on my phone. The batteries die pretty quick, I bought this as a second action cam to use for a different angle. The reviews I saw made it look impressive. My main camera is a Gopro Hero 4 so the video and audio quality just doesn't compare. If you were using 2 or 3 of these you could get by ok but this one just can't begin to keep up. It's kinda like a Volkswagen and a Ferrari having a race.One handy item with it that I didn't think I would use in the remote control. For videos, I just don't see much use but for snapping a picture it does \"ok\"., Not what I expected., Did not like that it was not compatible with my laptop or my android phone.  I needed a Mac computer or video editor to down load my videos., Fell off my motorcycle and broke and pieces first time out never got to use it, This product never worked. I took two videos and then it stopped turning on. Being the only camera I took on my trip to Egypt, I was very dissapointed., Takes amazing still shots at 60 fps while traveling at 55+ mph. Do not buy this if you are mounting it to anything that goes down the road. Instead spend a few dollars more and get the Brave 4 which is the upgrade to this model, which includes image stabilization. I can't report yet on how good that feature is on the other camera having bought it to replace this one. However, this one creates unwatchable video, at least mounted to a motorcycle. The image shudder is horrendous. You see some four different layers of the horizon jumbled together when playing back the video on the computer.  On this lower model the remote required the camera to be active for the two buttons to work. They do not turn the camera on. They don't stay lit as an indicator. On the back the lcd is nice, but to determine which mode is active, you have to look closely for the white camera icon to go red, when recording. When taking a snapshot, the screen flickers and resets to the camera, non recording mode. I used this flickering  indicator to know if the camera was recording, while looking through a tinted windshield where its mounted on the front of my bike.The upper model seems to have addressed some of these concerns, for the better. I'll have to review it once i get out on the bike and test it. There is yet another model that is even higher priced than the Brave 4, that one s You tuber claimed had real 4k and not digitally processed 4k like these two lower models, if that's a concern. I had no complaint with the still frame on this camera at speed, set to 60fps, even if it is not true 4k., This arrived with the plastic part that holds the camera to the handle broken.  It worked for the first couple of days, then the charging became iffy to the point where I had to hold the cable titled for it to charge. Then the next day the USB port fell inward into the unit and it could no longer charge.  The failure of the USB port after only a couple uses indicates that the manufacturing of this product is inferior. The camera was returned., Used it 4 times and now it doesn't work. I hope the added warranty is better than the camera., I bought this camera to help record a ski trip with my kids.  The biggest negative I have for it is that the camera is not waterproof.  I couldn't get any audio with the camera because it was stuck inside a waterproof case the whole time.  The worst part is the case got scratched on the lense so now I cant use the case and cant seem to find a replacement., DONT DO IT!!! My husband and I got this for our cruise and the SD card wouldn’t go in the camera. It’s like a piece was blocking it from going in so we couldn’t use it at all. Tried to get in contact and nothing. Spend the extra money for name brand of this is what off brand is like., I appreciate the quality of this product, Just received this yesterday. I have downloaded to apps in order to get videos. One says it download once you go to it you can only hear it. The other one let's you download it but can't share it anywhere because it's only the sound as well. You need a better app for people who only have phones to use. I'm going to try a couple more things but so far not really that great because of the app. If someone could let me know what they use for their phone that would be great. Thanks, Positive: product is cheap compare with others in the market. Image and video quality are okay.Negative: wifi features along with app connectivity are bad. Disconnects for no reason and is hard to manage. Sometime it will disconnect from the app but you couldn't work with it manually, unless you give it a hard reset (disconnect the battery). If you want better quality and connection I suggest you go with a GoPro., This item have been open before arriving to me . It box was without its brand new warranty seal, it is very shame why is happening it ? . It is lack of respect to the costumer;  please., Very poor quality overall. Picture, sound, stabilization are all not very good. After reading the other reviews that were positive, I don’t know if I even had the sam camera. Used it for a few hours and tried to be positive. After that, I returned it and got a Go Pro and I am so much happier., This camera came with so many amazing features and accessories! I love how great the underwater camera quality is and that it comes with two rechargeable batteries instead of constantly buying new batteries. It's super easy to use; my 4-year old can even operate it in the pool. Definitely recommend., My wife and I really liked it. For this price to be able to get a solid camera was really clutch! We went on a trip to DR and used it for a variety of adventures and I’m no camera guru at all. Can’t wait to try it for extreme uses., Used camera in and out of water works great the handle on camera needs to be longer to help stabilize the camera shot, Use this for my motorcycle. It does the job for cheap if you're looking for an action cam. 1 thing I would advise is to stock up on extra batteries. My daily commute is approximately 20 minutes and when I arrive, battery is near empty already. Maybe it's my settings(?) Not bad, just expecting a bit more., It works great! Sound is quiet if not connected to the iSmart dv app., Battery life last less than 90 minutes. Screen turns black when you are recording, so you can't see what you are filming. I wouldn't recommend it. I thought it was good at first but for longevity it isn't worth it. If you only plan to do 30 minutes between charges then it is right for you., I'm very happy with this camera. It comes with two rechargeable batteries, several mounts and a water-proof case for underwater footage., I picked this up for an up and coming trip as my primary camera failed after about 17 years (canon). I realize this isnt expected to perform on still photos as well as an SLR but i figured it would do as well as my cheap phone. It doesnt. Still photos are blurred no matter how they are taken. If you use them for thumbnails they are fine but if you plan to take stills of your trips do NOT use this as you will be very disappointed. The remote works. The \"water proof\" case is more like water resistant on the low end. Drop it in the tub its not going to protect your camera in my testing. Also the accessories everyone raves about. Almost all of them are useless outside buying more parts. They have a pamphlet that comes with the device you have to register to get the \"good stuff\". I refuse to do this because it means more spam. It borders on misleading. Anyhow, good low end, cheap and second camera ok for primary \"action\" video but nothing to write home about., good camera for price  def worth it just wish batterys lasted longer, OK here's my review I've loved the camera for since I purchased it and have taken many beautiful videos however, I just discovered that there's really no way of editing it I'm not sure why that is I expected it to be just as easy to edit it as a go pro but it's not.  So if you wanna just look at the videos that you shoot without editing  them it's a good camera takes great pictures but for me without the ability to edit it's basically worthless. I downloaded about 6 different editing software apps on my phone and none of them will recognize the video file.  It would be nice if the company that makes these cameras addressed this issue., - Price is awesome! Won't give me a heart-attack in case I lost it while having outdoor activities.- Camera is small and light enough to be attached to wrist- Camera is water-proof and operates well in water- Images and videos are stable and good quality for this price- It served us well in a recent rafting trip to Yellowstone and more ski trips in the winter., The camara stop recording for not reason and When it was recording you can not watch all the videos. Only a few. And the others video shows error, My son and I started using the AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports Action Camera Ultra HD Waterproof DV Camcorder 12MP 170 Degree Wide Angle yesterday and he had an absolute blast with it. Picture quality was great!  Unfortunately, as we were charging it this morning, the charging port pushed directly into the camera and was shaking around inside! We were able to unscrew the front of the camera and remove the charging port. It looks like it was only attached with two small tack welds. I emailed the company (through Amazon), but Amazon responded that there is an issue with the email address the company provided.  I didn't expect this camera to last forever, but I did expect the charging port to last more than 24 hours!, The camera has one of the worst picture and sound quality I've seen., Our gopro got water in it and ruined, so we wanted a replacement without spending so much money. This is the same size as a gopro...pretty good quality video. It came with 2 rechargeable batteries.  We also got the accessories which are a good cost and have so many options. If you do not want to spend a lot of money this is a great option for you!, It’s works great. My only problem with it is that I was recording a thing for my school and it would suddenly freeze and the only way to fix it was  to take out the battery. Apon further inspection, it would freeze whenever shaken too harshly., Finally got to use my camera on a scuba dive. But didn't really use it cause it leaked and is now not in my return window! Super disappointed!, This camera has ok image quality. It has a short battery life when recording, only about 1 hour. It does not come with a memory card.Rated 3 stars because of the short recording time/ battery life., Image quality for the money was good. Image stabilization not good. Good camera for the money, This camera ruined my motorcycle trip to morocco.  I was hopeing to get some footage of my motorcycle trip.  This camera would not work for me.  It continually froze and would become unresponsive after less than 5 minutes of operation., Nice little action cam for the price. Takes good video. Sound is not the best., Really really poor camera and sound quality. Waste of money to be honest. Bought to record vacation memories and aircraft takeoffs and landings. The sound quality is the worst., The video quality is just ok. This is a case where you see 4K and think its gonna be great, then you get it and its just OK., It is a small camera and I like that. I can take it with me wherever I go if I need it. I like the battery. And is easy to take pictures and video but I don't like too much the picture quality and color balance. All depends how you want to use it., Unfortunately I haven't been able to use this camera but twice. The battery says charged but when I unplug from the power source it shuts off. The buttons are confusing. Manual was no help. I was really excited to get and use this camera for my horse back riding but guess I will look for something else., This is a great alternative to trendy GoPro cameras. It has all the features the kids are looking for for sport videos and more., Good amount of accessories and quality seems as good as the GoPro., Not a bad camera just not was i was expecting. Having a GoPro this doesn’t really compare., After 3 weeks it stopped working.  I returned it for a full refund and got myself a GoPro Hero 5.  It is working well, and longer than this camera.  I would have kept it, had it continued to work., I actually bought 2. I'm changing my original 4 stars to just 2. The quality of the videos I shot and downloaded are very poor. Not the quality of my work! But from the camera. From both cameras. When I first noticed I went and shot with the other camera. Same thing! It's very disappointing., You get what you pay for.... video is extremely jumpy. Picture doesn’t even seem to be 720p., If you want to record your bike rides, this camera is NOT a good choice. It doesn’t have any image stabilization., Image is not clear, not 4K, This camera is easy to use and takes really good clear pictures. I've used this during hunts and for other random things. Great camera., Before I could use it for the third time. The clip that holds the buttons in place. The one for the power. Came off!! No it's useless under water or in salt air conditions!! Not happy at all!!! It was a week old at best!!, A little shakey when running but overall it's a nice camera for the price, Great videos, but the battery life is goes quickly., The battery didn't last very long - a couple hours at most.  The plus side is the camera comes with two rechargeable batteries so I was able to replace it when it died.  Video quality was good, picture quality left much to be desired.  I could've taken better pictures on my phone.  Sound is almost non-existent when in the water proof case.  It comes with many accessories that I couldn't figure out and the manual was no help.  Tons of accessories but not one selfie stick which is really what we wanted.  I bought this for a trip to Kauai and it served its purpose.  If you're looking for an affordable option for a vacation I recommend buying this camera.  If you're looking to get more usage than one trip, I'd recommend investing in a better camera., Great Color. But battery only lasts about 30 minutes., Quality seems very solid, has gone on a few kayaking trips so far and the waterproofing is up to the job.  Video quality is really good although I'll admit I haven't spent any time testing its limits as far as fast action or low light conditions.  I'll probably buy a few more, I have a Gen 1 Gopro Hero and this easily meets the same quality plus more features., Just check the video for yourself! This is a recording of the Audio/Video Sync Test available on YouTube that I recorded just minutes ago. I have emailed Akaso support. I'll provide an update once I hear back., The charging port no longer works, seems the fins in the actual port bent over?, Great value on the dollar., Got this for a trip to the USVI and got some great moments with it, This does not include a needed micro card., I purchased this item thinking it would be a bargain deal that's comparable to GoPro. They're incomparable and I wished I would've spent a little extra for a much better quality GoPro., Like how portable it is yet provides great quality videos, Great for the price. However, it only takes good video and pictures in high light. Low light settings look terrible. Definitely not 1080 p., Video quality is very poor. Cannot be use for anything proper. Phone take a better video, Just bought this for my daughter’s birthday. She will be using this on our vacation this summer!, I bought this camera as a good alternative to the name brand rival that is 5 times the cost, figured what do I have to lose, it’s only $75. I was actually pleasantly suprised that the video quality above and under water is really good. Then I downloaded the software from the app store and was wondering why it has so many bad reviews and barely a 2 star rating. After installing it I attempted to transfer some of my videos from the camera to my phone and the app would crash on any video that is longer then 1 minute in length. Also the downloaded videos remain with in the app and can’t be saved to your stream. In conclusion the iphone app is very poor quality and if you don’t mind removing the SD card to copy the video to your computer then this camera is a good buy, otherwise if you want to use the app on your phone and to transfer the video footage to your phone over wifi I would not recommend this camera or this brand, Image quality and stabilization is bad. Returning the product., Doesn't work properly as expected some time it turns on some time it doesn't battery were fully charge this item sucks, Really easy set up, Works Great!, I used it in my car to capture the back roads and the battery life is a lot shorter than another action camera.  Used it once ride and returned it just because of battery life., Nice action cam but they could do better no stabilization at all, No instructions included but did come with a good bit of attachments, It’s okay... I bought a memory card. When I video the screen blacks out after a min. There were bubbles on the screen when I opened it., I liked the camera and had good picture., Unfortunately the cover of my battery broke and now I can’t used, I wish they would include in the description somewhere that this camera does NOT include audio! Only photo/video. Waste of money for me.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The laptop arrived just in time for school!! Works great., Product description very much lied about the keyboard being backlit. Pretty pissed about that considering it the reason I chose this laptop over others I was looking at. Otherwise, it works fine for the basic little wprd processor I use it for. Also, not a cool design like any online description of the model. This one is straight flat black. Incredibly plain-looking. And one of my keys is at a wonky angle, but it works. Considering the ither asus products I own, this one falls short, honestly.If you want to take it out of S Mode, go to activation and choose to change your edition to regular Windows Home. Its a free switch., Works good.But the keyboard is not backlit.Good buy, if you don't need a backlit keyboard., I love how light weight and compact it is. And the numeric pad as well. So far I’m pretty happy and content with it., I ordered this small laptop for work purposes and general office operations.  So far, it's been well worth the money.  I took it out of Windows S mode.  It struggled (lagged) a bit with Chrome, so I resorted to using the Microsoft Internet browser but it's been fine.  And since I only use it for work (general office stuff), it's done everything that I could have asked....thus far!, The number dial is pretty accurate. Sleek design and very lightweight. Perfect product for the average commuter, If you feel that you need the trifling advantage of the \"easy access\" NumberPad, go ahead and buy this one. If you don't, avoid this one--it's a constant annoyance. Think you can permanently disable the NumberPad? Good luck with that., Amazing product it’s small do you can easily carry it around with no extra weight, For 190 bucks, this is perfect. I think tablets are very overrated.  I only like touchscreens on a phone.  This computer is the size of a tablet, incredibly light.  I just wanted something to do my financial stuff, email, shop and casually browse the internet.  I don't watch movies on my computer but it plays you tube type videos just fine.  sound is a little weak but if I want to listen to music I can cast it to my stereo.  What I like best is the size and weight. Small and light. And it seems to be built solid. I charge it at night and use it off and on all day and there is plenty of juice left. I could probably charge it every other night if I wanted.  I've only had it a couple weeks but I feel very good about my purchase., Screen was good but touch screen sucked...the lol mouse would disappear from screen and just pop up anywhere and wouldnt click on items the 1st click(it takes multiple clicks to get to where I'm trying to go)., It is perfect for my personal use and easy to navigate. Light weight and fits into my bag to carry with me., I like the size and for the price it’s worth buying., small, compact and convenient, Stay away from Windows 10 S ! Let me tell you what it is ..... trash 🗑!!!!!!! You can’t download anything from browser unless is from their crappy App Store! I couldn’t download Sketchup ! This is the worst part you CANT use GOOGLE!!! Like what the F ! They only allow you to use Bing ,who in the right mind uses that search engine!! No oneeee! You have to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to Windows 10 pro to be able to use your brand new computer like a normal person would like to do! Very very disappointed with this stupid “windows 10s” upgrade! (Not even an upgrade)!!!!! Please do your self a favor and buy a Mac !, My wife bought this for email and Facebook essentially. I had to uninstall the Windows 10S features because it kept freezing on the screen that said only approved windows 10 S apps would work.This warning came up randomly even though the only apps on the laptop WERE from the Microsoft App store.Finally I said ok no more Windows 10S and dropped it in favor of plain Windows 10. Since that time there has been no problem and no discernible detriment to the function. It is very small so be advised if this is a concern., ********************************** 07/24/2021 **********************************being firmilier with windows seizing possession of computers overclocking chip-sets and burning them out first on my listidisabled secure boot and set the supervisor password in bios so windows andits automatic this and automatic that could not inflict further damage to thehardware without firstly obtaining my express permissionnot trusting windows and its most advanced network hacking teqnikesi then proceeded to install my 9 GB linux clone in 10 minutes flathowever i needed windows to register this new computer sos i started windowsafter setup finished without a internet connection it said theres nointernet conection try this troubleshooterwhich arived at the decision that i needed to reset the router (NOT TRUE)  duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhbut why win 10 was updating at chip sizlun full throttle thats the true reason  out of pure curiosity i let this rogue os update it took a full day and a halfbefore i could use edge browser to register in my asusand by the way my last laptop used to do the same thing everytime itupdated until i**************************************************************** disabled the automatic updates  ** by setting the ipv4 gateway address to a bad address ** and unchecking ipv6 protocal  ** in the network configuration dialogue  ****************************************************************2 words braught the micysoft madness to a sqeeky halt********  GRUB-INSTALL *********the wifi chip is a realtekRTL8821CE---the cpu temp is a cool 100 degree farenhite after waking from a nap---and under your control linux will run your chipset at 108 degrees farenheightat idle with bluetooth radio on---in linuxvbox windows 98 running the yamaha SYXG50 soft synthysizer which by the wayrenders the dsp effects in software on 12 miditracks laden with yamaha sysex register 20% cpu utilizationand 117 degree farenheit cpu temp and play hifi music without hickupthis vm cuts the battery life to about 9 hours---also the battery has about 19 hours of secure browsing in it using 2048 bitencryption over bluetooth connect---intense usage such as simultaniuos remote desktop and ssl secure browsing bringtemp to even 120 degree and battery life is 1 hour per 10 percent battery capacity---running linux headless and radio off give you > 40 hours of batteryapache2 server + file sharing + encrypted ssh is on---in linuxthe 14 inch keyboard is backlighted up for your pleasure and for due reasonit is almost impossible to see your key in anything but direct sunlighthowever this is a much needed feature regaurdless  A very usefull feature on the extended keyboard is the well placed home and end keyit follows the standard template for laptops except there is one more row on the far rightwhich has the following keyspower buttonhomepage uppage downendFN*******************************************************************************linux xcfe desktop uses about 1.1 gig of memory out of the installed 4 Gigwith 6 virtual desktops and 5 different apps running*******************************************************************************the charging cord is 6 foot loong and she charges up from 50% to 99% in > a hour*******************************************************************************the integrated video tops out at 1920x1080 and bottoms out at 320x180and refresh rates vary from 60 hz to 120 hzthe battery life sinks exponentialy with increased resolution and refresh rates, I just wanted something simple to use for files and meetings. However, the webcam is awful. The image is poor quality and if you move at all you will be one big blur, so I will need to buy a separate webcam to use. The key clicks are loud as you type, and although the number pad on the mouse pad is a nifty option, it will come on and off when you don't intend it to. Overall, not bad for the price, but the high rating seems to be misleading. Not sure how much I trust Amazon reviews at this point, I saw no mention of the poor quality webcam and that was one thing I noticed right off the bat considering how prevalent Zoom is nowadays., Worked great out of the box but would not turn on the next day.  Shame as it was perfect for my needs., Quit working after a week, It has M.2 which supports NVMe SSD.soldered RAM, works pretty fine to me. I buy it for my daughter and it have all thing that she needs., Perhaps I goofed or something, but even a live boot wouldn't take., It is not user friendly., Well worth the price. Small long battery life. Enough capability to support remote learning, Cheap Chinese garbage, So far the L210 slim laptop is good for working on projects and would make a great investment for a highschool or college grade laptop. Had to make a couple adjustments like uninstall the graphics driver and install the intel one because graphics problems with chrome as well as in chrome disable the \"use hardware acceleration when available\" setting because of graphics errors caused. the other adjustment made was creating my own power plan because with the one that comes pre-made for it doesnt do the laptop much justice. basic power plan was 4-6 hours on battery but with a well setup plan have it setup it can do 6-10 hours with videos and 10-12 hours on everything else from browsing web to having multiple programs running. some stuff you should know is the graphics is 2gb which can handle 1080 videos easy depending on your internet speed. 4gb of ram and barely any is actually used unless you have alot of programs running at once. the processor says 1.2ghz dual core but the speeds that have been running are  1.8-4ghz so far depending on whats running. doesnt get too hot when running games or videos so wont get burns when sitting a your lap. 1 thing tho is that it is listed as having a backlit keyboard but it does not have one. After dealing with windows updates and driver updates theres around 20-25 gb left of space available so if you decide to buy one of these laptops make sure to get a micro sd card for it so you can expand the space and i recommend 120-500 gig., Works good, fast, light weight., Outside of the mouse pad \" I like it a lot.\", It's been more than a month since I got mine and about 3 weeks in the touch pad stopped working. Trying getting it fixed by a technician who wants an arm and a leg to fix it. I'm not a fan of using a mouse so disappointment is an understatement at this stage., Remember you get what you pay for. Very slow but for paying bills and very light gaming it is serviceable., Initially I thought I'd gotten one of those rare deals ... something fairly good for a lower price.  I was being optimistic.1.  Screen saver doesn't work2.  When in \"sleep\", you can't always get the computer to wake up - you have to reboot3.  Applications lock randomly - Chrome, Excel etc - initially thought it happened after the laptop had been idle for awhile - but it happens randomly at any time, even when in use.  Some or all app's become locked/unresponsive and you have to close/restart them4. This is more a personal gripe - the sound quality is very poor.  But again, it's a low end computer so it really should be expected - I just didn't expect the sound to be this bad.On the plus side -1.  It is fairly fast and boots quickly, The picture description says BACK-LIT KEYBOARD, but it isn't! Whomever designed the website for ASUS should be fired! I went through a big hassle trying to find an ASUS laptop that actually had the back-lit keyboard that was advertised on several of their models, but didn't have it! I wound up buying an ASUS 14\" laptop that actually had the ADVERTISED back-lit keyboard from Office Depot/Office Max. I had them verify it before I bought it., USPS delivered this today. Big box with a fairly big box (and padding) in it with a small and light laptop in that. I had it unpacked and charging in no time.Since I never intended to ever use the WIN10 installed on it (or even boot it) it took a bit to figure out how to get into the computer settings so that I could boot from a USB drive that I had Linux Mint installer loaded on.A WORD OF CAUTION for those that are going to install Linux - the current popular install .ISO's don't have the drivers for the WIFI chip! The drivers will have to be installed manually. Bluetooth does however work and I was easily able to link this computer to my iPhone and get out to the internet that way.WORK A ROUND: I ordered a cheap (~$20) \"TP Link\" USB 802.11N (only 2.5Ghz) Wifi adapter, plugged it in and it just works. Maybe someday Linux will have drivers for the built in WiFi chip in this device.While the only CPU'S that Intel makes that are crapper than a Celeron is a Atom I found this on the web:\"The Intel Celeron N4020 is one of the most budget-friendly and power-efficient laptop processors. ... As for gaming, the Intel UHD 600 graphics of the Celeron N4020 is one of the weakest solutions. It can be used only for the lightest games.\"To sum up the above, it is a very cheap and uses very little power.For its size, the keyboard and screen are ok. The keys have good travel. It has a matte screen.This is a small and very light computer. It is 'snappy' enough surfing the web and running Linux native applications. While I'm not clear on this but it appears that it can be charged with a standard USB-C charger.I'll have to take it out in the wild to see how the battery life holds up on it. Running Linux the battery should last as least as long (or longer!) than it does while running WIN10., I bought this laptop to use for leisure travel this next year.  Wanted something bigger and more useful than the tablet I currently have.  While I have just started the setup process, ie loading my apps, files, etc., it is doing exactly what I wanted it to do.  I've switched to Windows Home, installed all my apps and it's currently updating Windows.  It is showing lots of promise!, This was a MAJOR selling feature for me since I work nights. Description needs updated., It's fine otherwise, but the trac pad stopped working a few days after we started using it., Recieved yesterday.Still reading info on using micro soft...... I'm use to Google use but this lap top has much more to offer IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET USE TO IT.., Purchased this laptop in March 2021 and it only lasted six months with light use. One day I could no longer connect to the internet. Ran the troubleshooter and it said it could not find a network adapter. Tried everything suggested, but still can't connect to the internet. Total waste of money!, I am giving this tablet two stars as it is inexpensive (under $200) and lightweight, other than that I would give it one star.  I should have read the description more carefully as it is not a touchscreen model.  Get your fingers to work on the touchpad if hard enough but the way this was designed if you aren't very careful you are constantly turning on the numbering feature.  It is a serious stupid design.  You have all the number above the alpha keys. Grab a calculator if you need it.  I waited too long on return it., Excellent for just information support for your job, 365 micro soft is useless, For the price you can’t complain it works for basic usage as browsing the Internet. I would recommend for anyone who needs a laptop with basic functionality ., Easy to use, up in a second.  I love it.  Then I realized that I couldn't hear a damn thing.  I'm on a computer 12 hours a day, I know how to work them.  I adjusted the controls...blah blah.  Could barely hear the volume on some things, particularly YOUTUBE.  Finally looked and lo and behold, the speaker are on the bottom. How in the hell can speakers project when you have the danged thing in your lap?  My thighs completely block all sound.  So in order to hear certain things, I have to hold it up to my face.  Yes, I've trouble shooted everything. Yes, I know what I'm doing, and Yes, I'm sending it back.  SOUND SUCKS and I don't want to have a little speaker attached to the top so I can hear., Perfect for what it has been designed for: internet browsing, music, playing videos. can play Terraria, Arrived without windows bootingUpon boot enter BIOS and I get “no bootable device”. You can tell the manual has been beat up. When filling in return on Amazon I find support phone number but despite being advertised as open nobody answers., I dislike the confusion with it's programs. Not one to be a \"refresher\" on..after so many years!I feel I made a mistake with choosing this.., Laptop is smaller but has everything you need for school and very light so easy to travel with overall good computer for price, Sound stopped working completely after a week, It won't turn on after having it led than 30 days, What I expected, It’s cute, and quiet, but the screen is made in a way that you HAVE to look at it at a certain angle or it feels weird on your eyes and only the center circle is bright while the edges appear dark.  I’ve never hated a laptop screen so much. It’s almost like it has a privacy screen on it., Well it really wasn't what I was looking for. It's kinda slow, and I really couldn't get too many good apps on it. And it seems much smaller than what it's size is supposed to be., I wanted this laptop to do only one thing - act as the control for a label printer, but it couldn't even do that. It took forever to boot, and everyday tasks kept crashing it. Totally useless! I returned it as soon as I could get it to shutdown., This computer was a great purchase for my son. He likes to play Roblox, Minecraft and Steam games. This computer has the capability and speed to play these games and plenty of room to hold them. It is not a gaming computer but is capable of playing these games without too much lag time. The touchpad that moves the mouse icon does like to stop responding to touch but simply press the F6 key to toggle it back on and off and it will start working or plug in a mouse. The battery lasts an extremely long amount of time. The display is very clear and good quality. Excellent product for the price. The seller, Lucky Trading, has excellent customer service and was very helpful with communication and when I needed product support. Highly recommended., I only needed the computer for zoom.  Whenever I touched the mic I had to hit it several times to turn on mic to speak.  It was a pain so I returned the computer.  I prefer touch screen & a larger screen., It took about ten minutes to download Google Chrome, and when it did, simply opening a new tab on the app took at least two minutes for it to fully load. I bought this laptop to use for writing and schoolwork, but the speed was just unbearable., Much smaller than I imagine but was ok. Easy to carry around, fast enough for my use., Dislike nothing! I use it for work  l like that it was easy to use, It's a laptop and it does laptop things. If you need it to do heavy intensive things, it might not do the things.But if you keep your expectations low, you'll probably not be disappointed., The size and range of motion is pretty coolEdit: the family safety automatically being turned on is irritating. The dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. I’ve taken some mins to set the computer up I don’t want to spend more time, Screen might put some people off. Battery is phenomenal, it’s silent, and the audio is fine. Perfect for on the go.   \n",
       "4  Bought for school work. Doing good so far.Sleek., It's alright, I bought this laptop a week ago. The touch pad worked at first. Once, I upgraded Windows 10. The touch pad stopped working. I went to the Acer site, to download a new driver for this pos. Of course it didn't work. That's why I'm giving this a bad review! I've tried several things to fix this laptop. None of them worked!, My son loves his laptop, One of his favorite devices so far.. One suggestion by memory card to go along with this laptop, I purchased this for my online college classes and am so glad I did. Awesome product!, This computer has totally inadequate volume.  The return was readily accepted by the seller but when I actually took the computer into the UPS store, I had to pay $21 to have it shipped WITH the properly printed return label !  Never had to pay to return an Amazon purchase before!!!!  What a ripoff!!!, Best laptop for this price, 5 star, I love everything about this laptop!, Horribly horrible computer! Do not buy! Screen went out in less than a week! Only used it once or twice before it went to H E double hockey sticks to, The trackpad has scrapes in it when I got it. Returned it, it's been two weeks and I'm being told it will take another 2 weeks for my refund to process. The body is also thin plastic and not metal like some other aspire 7s, including the trackpad. Get another gaming laptop, the ROG zephyrus g14 is on sale at best buy right now for almost the same price with a better GPU & CPU and an all aluminum chassis., Basically the one thing that turned me off is that it warns you not to download the Google browser because it may make it unstable., This will be my last Acer. I expect notebooks to last around  3 years and that is when you actually use it. I used this one as a spare and hardly used it at all. In fact I just found it does not even have a battery that you can take out. I would not recommend this product., GREAT little laptop. Performs well. I do mostly work on it (Microsoft Office, Audio editing on Audacity, minor video editing and some music composition with Sibelius) and it runs flawlessly. Occasionally I travel and play games on it (league of Legends and World of Warcraft) and it runs those just fine too (WoW on lower graphics settings). only down side to this machine is there's VERY little memory. Make absolutely sure you budget for cloud storage, or an external hard drive if you go with this machine., Not nearly enough RAM, slows up with just basic web browsing, This is a great laptop for the price, but the worst thing about it is the placement of the touchpad, it's on the left hand side below the keyboard, which makes no sense.  It should be centered or more on the right.The screen color is also a bit bright, so if you want to edit photos on here beware of that.  Also this thing is kinda heavy., This is not bad, but I would not buy it again. The speakers are horrible and under the computer. making it hard to hear (I am deaf) and you have to pick up the computer to hear them. The cap lock key does not a light on it let you know it is on. Drives me crazy. No CD Rom either.  :(, Love this laptop except why would you put the speakers on the bottom which makes the sound horrible?  At least make the max volume higher so you can at least hear without needing external speakers!, Initially, once I set everything up, I was pretty pleased with my purchase! But after a little over a month (and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month), the screen went black but the back-light on the keyboard was still on. So, I figured it just needed to be charged. I left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it. Still, lit keys but no screen. So I changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more. Came back to it, same thing. I tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference. I never took it out of \"S\" mode, and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs. Basically, just checked my email a few times. Now when I plug it in, nothing lights up. The adapter on the charger doesn't have any indicator light to show that it's working, so it could be a faulty power cord.I'm going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers. But in any case, a brand new device should last longer than a month.Now my return window has closed so I'm either stuck with a $350 paperweight, or I'll have to search online and buy a new charger and hope that works..., I do not spend a lot of time on the computer. I purchased the computer so I could do some personal writing. I like the fact that it had Microsoft Office installed. I did not like the the restriction to only use apps provided through the Microsoft store.  To download other apps, like zoom, I had to disable the Microsoft security system, which cannot now be reactivated on my machine.  But as far as general use of the computer, it has been great., Unfortunately, I have to write a bad review on this one. I have babied this laptop and while it was a decent for cheap laptop, I can't believe it just died on me after 14 months. I didn't get a warranty because the price was more than half of the laptop cost...again, inexpensive laptop. I expect slow, etc. but not death., Easy to set up, liked the keyboard. I added another 4 GB memory.  Just a nice overall laptop., It is a lot smaller screen, keyboard, etc., than I had before.  Though I had an Acer Aspire before.  I don't like it, probably will return it, and wouldn't recomment it for older people., Nice laptop for the money. I still don't like Windows. Battery life is lousy, My lab top has quit working. It will not restart it is froze & my mouse will not work it won’t let me do anything, For the price point its a great laptop. First I added another 2GB RAM for under $20 and upgraded. Before I start with the positive one big negative. When the laptop goes to sleep mode, it take 25-40 sec before it wakes up. It's very strange. Its not a traditional hard drive. I didnt change any settings. I have to hit the power button and literally sit there for it to turn on. Pretty annoying. Other than that screen quality is phenomenal. Speed is more than adequate for MS office apps . It can also handle streaming and 8-10 browsers at a time.  For school, work , anything non hardcore this is a good laptop. Sound quality I aways use my bluetooth headset anyway. Sound is bit more towards the stereo sound. I am sure that can be adjusted, just havn't played with it.Like others have said, you cannot go wrong at this price point. I just hope it lasts and dont bog down or slow down with updates and what not...., this laptop is giving me nightmares. the touchpad is super sensitive to \"accidentally\" turning off. ok, fine. restart and it's back to normal if nothing else works (forgetting the inconvenience). then this morning after an update to windows 10, the touchpad isn't simply off. it isn't in settings, there are no drivers, it's just effing gone. so here i am, using a mouse i hate, because the laptop basically doesn't work as a laptop. take into consideration when thinking about purchasing this model. it's cheap, yes, but if you actually need to use on the go or in your lap, it's a bad choice., I purchased this laptop for general purposes as well as using the Cricut Desgin Space for my Cricut machine. My old laptop was just running too slowly and I needed an upgrade. First off, the price is amazing, and I'm fully aware that you get what you paid for but I feel like I got MORE than I paid for with this. I don't know much about specs and the ins and outs of computers so here are some pros and cons from a general user:PROS:- The look and design is very very sleek- Fairly lightweight- The screen resolution - AMAZING!- It seems fast so far- The battery life is very good. I've been working continuously for about three hours now without it plugged in and I still have 1/4 battery life left.- It does come downloaded with Windows 10 S Mode however there's literally a sticker directly on the box directing you to a website that explains a STUPIDLY EASY four step process to permanently get out of S mode. It was the first thing I did (based on other reviews) and have no issues. IT WAS FREE TO DO AND TOOK 2 MINUTES!!CONS:- Caps Lock/Num Lock do not have an indicator light. I'm already finding this very annoying but I use a USB keyboard most of the time anyway so it's fine.- The sound is awful. If you're using this laptop for streaming, games, etc. you will need headphones. No seriously... it's really bad. The quality is okay but it does not get loud AT ALL.Overall with a couple of days of use I'm impressed with this!!! Purchase ASAP if you're looking for an affordable general use laptop :), I bought this laptop for my wife for her job. I wanted something not pricey and just something that worked. I saw the high amount of five star reviews and I read through some of the lower starred reviews and thought, that won't happen to me, BS!!First of all, the computer got shipped quickly and got here undamaged but that is the only good I can say about it. The backlight for the keyboard goes off quickly and you have to press a key to turn it back on instead of moving the mouse and you cannot change it. As you may have read in other reviews, the computer comes with Windows 10 S Mode installed but my product key is not genuine. It says that the digital license is not valid. Because of this it WILL NOT ACTIVATE WINDOWS. Which means I CANNOT TAKE IT OUT OF S MODE. If the computer is in S Mode then you cannot download any apps or programs that you would normally use like Mozilla or VLC or even Chrome. And furthermore, you cannot access the Command Prompt which means you cannot even activate the Windows even if you wanted to.I have contacted Microsoft who told me that they could not do anything and to contact ACER. I contacted ACER and they told me to try one single thing, which I already did and confirmed that it does not work, then told me I had to send in the laptop to the techs which would take another two weeks just to get it back.Sooooooooooooooooo, long story short, it is a never ending loop of disappointment, anger and resentment and a complete waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE., This laptop was overpriced., Screen quality is decentTouch screen not reallyThis isn’t a gaming laptopTurn off the wifi so it doesnt interfere with your cell phones connectivity or other tablet/computer., Overall, a great laptop for the price. I added 8G of RAM really easily. It is fast and cheap. However, some technical issues:- S mode is horrible. Got rid of it immediately.- My powerpoint screen recording function would not work. Called Microsoft and they were very helpful. They rolled back my display driver to Microsoft Basic and worked perfectly, but then the computer would not recognize my second screen. Called Acer, and they told me they didn't have another display driver to download and referred me to a third party (Answers By) that wanted to charge me $99 to fix the issue...- For some reason, the internet was really slow. Played with two different routers I had. It was still slow even with a tri-band router and no other devices connected to the internet. Then, I connected to the guest wifi I had set up and it worked perfectly. I suspect this may be a driver/software issue.For the price, it is hard to beat this, but get ready for some compatibility issues and no support from ACER..., THIS PC WAS GOOD BUT THE CAMERA DID NOT WORK I OPENED CASE THEY COULD NOT FIS IT  POOR PRODUCT SUPPORT DOD NOT BUY THIS PC  DO NOT BUY THIS PC. VERY POOR SUPPORT FROM AMAZON AND ACER, Product wouldn’t work out of the box, and after an hour with tech support made the decision to return., I love everything about this laptop. Especially the built in Alexa. It's so sleek and stylish. My daughter told me it looked just like her MAC laptop. Best buy anywhere for a laptop at a reasonable price with all the features!, Arrived late, Speaker volume is low.great LT for price! Won’t find anywhere else., Stopped working after 4 months of light use., The first time I attempted to use my webcam for a important Zoom interview, it would not work. After Acer did hours of trouble shooting, with no resolve, they told me I had no other choice but to reset my laptop to factory settings, which meant I lost almost everything I had on my laptop. When it was determined that losing all of my content was for nothing, they finally checked the device manager and discovered that no Webcam drivers had been installed! They then told me that I would have to pay to send the laptop back to them for repairs! I refused to pay out anything more. Needless to say I Will Never purchase from Acer again.!, Hard Drive crashed after 7 months and it was going to cost more than the computer to fix., Product arrived on time and was as advertised.  No surprises., Nothing special about this. Recent buy, no issues thus far. Appreciate the graphics card vs the \"newer model\" with the integrated card. Helps with some lighter games and other graphics-intensive apps., Horrible product. Bought it in March and it keeps disconnecting from the internet, sound is absolutely horrible. Now I have a laptop that is absolutely useless., It will not stay connected to WiFi - I constantly have to reconnect to wifi even after just a few minutes of inactivity., Everything is good for the price but  the volume  is to low... l had to return and get an apple instead. Even though it is double the price., This is a nice laptop for the price.  No issues so far at all.  I did need to take it out of S mode in order to install Zoom which is basically mandatory these days., The batter life is trash, and heats up fast, I bought this entry level Acer as an extra to have around and wasn't expecting much for the price.  Everything about this computer is very good EXCEPT for the low volume of the sound.  I'm not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume. I wasn't expecting BOSE quality, but I was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100%; it isn't.  Here's what I did, checked drivers, opened the Realtek to confirm all were set at 100%.  Upon researching other reviews, I noticed similar low volume issues; it appears that this is where Acer skimped. (I have an entry level Toshiba that has horrible quality sound, but it is loud.) I need to Blu-tooth an external speaker just so I don't have to bring my ears to w/in 8\" just to hear.  Of course, it doesn't help that Acer put the speakers on the bottom, yes, the bottom of the unit. It's a shame that Acer did so much right for the price, only to mess up on a incredibly low volume!  Would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100%?  The answer to my rhetorical question is no, but they did anyway.Overall, I would have given the unit 4 stars, maybe even 5, but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3, at best, unfortunately.My take-away is that I won't buy another Acer without hearing the sound first., built in camera and mic not working, Computer works well. Still trying to learn the operating system as it is different from the last computer., Worked fine for 13 months of occasional use, and then out of nowhere, the motherboard failed--just outside of the mfr warranty window. Piece of junk!, I absolutely love this laptop, key board lights went out and i am a senior citizen with eye problems who runs a help line to get services for families trying to get moms into recovery and am limited in times i can help to day times when i can see the keys, Microsoft edge is the worst browser first off, secondly this laptop did an automatic update and deleted several of my saved documents which are unrecoverable- hours of work are lost. It also blanked out 4x during a timed midterm exam last week.I have had this laptop for just 6 months - sad to say, I won’t purchase Acer again., I purchased this product based on many reviews .  After waiting 30 minutes to set up this thing, I called Acer support.  This thing would not set up Windows.  There is a 22 digit serial number that has to be provided fast and you have to use a telescope since the type is very small and is located no where near where the tech said it was.  Am going on 3 hours now to fully set thing up and am about ready to send it back.  Pure frustration.  This thing has all kinds of features but one important feature it lacks is the ability to set it up without having to take 3 hours of your life to do so.  Recommend you buy something else., overall its an ok computer , but the speakers seems damaged, its extremely low and theres a feedback, Computer works great, just as advertised, good value, would buy again, Works exactly how I expected it to and does everything I need it to do. A very good laptop for the price given., I got this for gaming by day 3 the touch pad stopped working. I troubleshooted it for days. Nothing worked. It only works with a mouse. I was very disappointed. I returned this item and will buy a different brand. Really sucks cause I liked it for gaming☹️, I have been very satisfied with this purchase so far.  I've only had it set up for less than a week, so I can't really state how well the battery is going to be,,,but so far it is great.  I have only had one small problem with setting up the email, but I'm just going on my web browser and accessing it from there, not sure what the problem is, probably something on my \"non-thechie\" side of the screen.  It is a great value for the money and I have absolutely no complaints.  The best feature I have found so far is the back lit keyboard....I had no idea how wonderful this would be....it's great.  I used to have to squint or turn on a light, but not anymore.  It's really an amazing little labptop and the screen is crystal clear.  The speed is very fast and so far I am loving this laptop way more than the last 2 Hewlett Packards that I have had to replace due to faulty battery setting.  I love this computer., Works like a charm, Keyboard start to having pressing issue after a while. Specially the one you use most. Otherwise it’s a great computer, I bought this computer for a new full time remote position. The computer is great for VERY BASIC NEEDS. Only a couple tabs open and browsing the internet. I needed to have 10+ tabs open and be able to toggle back and forth very quickly for my role and this computer could unfortunately not keep up. If you need something faster, I would get the same computer but with an i5 processor for $200 more. Well worth the difference. Have had the new computer for a week and it runs remarkable faster and can keep up with what I need done.Also, I plugged in a bluetooth mouse to this computer, and once I unplugged it, I could not get the touch pad to work anymore, so it is a good thing I am returning it as it also had this alternative issue., backlit keyboard is nice, but I hate to have to pay for word processing.  I hate this \"Gortana\" which pops up all the time., it is a cheaper computer that does its job.But the mouse pad thing doesn't work anymore. so I have to use a external mouse, This has the potential to be a good computer, but Acer ships this in S mode. Windows 10 Home cannot be activated. Running SLUI 4 will open the installation ID, but Microsoft cannot activate that number.  The agent said I needed to call Acer.  I called the toll-free number included with the computer and was told by that agent to call Microsoft (whodathunk?) or send it to Acer to be \"repaired.\"  It was out of the box for ten minutes and they wanted it to be repaired! Thanks to Amazon-- it is being returned.  Run  Away., I purchased this computer for my small business job. Within two weeks of use, the down key came off. Amazon's response is to glue the key down, which is ABSURD. You can't just glue a key down, which I explained, but they said that is all that they could do. They would not replace the computer., I purchased this laptop for school / social media / youtube / browsing & i absolutley love it. No complaints so far., It’s really good I actually got it two days earlier than they said they were going to send it to me which that is great, Not lasting more then 1hr! And lagging when you unplug the cable., Still working on this. Hope to up my rating if we can get things working. First experience with the system was very positive. Issue is that on day two I saw a message in the lower right corner of the screen: \"Go to settings to Activate Windows\". Settings says \"We can't activate Windows on this device because you don't have a valid digital license or product key. If you think you have a valid license or key, select Troubleshoot below. Troubleshooter says \"Something interrupted our troubleshooting.\" Called Acer support and was told they would mail me Windows Installation USB memory stick. Waited a little over one week and asked for status update. Was told that USB install media was not available, and I should contact Microsoft for activation. Entered last four digits from activation error message and was told I would need a new product key. Contacted Acer support again, and was told we would need to return the computer to the factory for fix; which could take 15-20 business days, plus shipping time. Briefly considered returning to Amazon, be decided to try the Acer service option. Will be awhile before we get it back., The physical device is very nice.  Lighted keyboard good EXCEPT no indicators for Caps Lock nor Num Lock.  That is unfortunate (what, Acer saved $2 to not include two little leds). Bluetooth non-operating out of the box so will need to troubleshoot.  Touchpad stopped functioning after a few weeks - another thing to troubleshoot...  Hope that is all the bad stuff that happens to this new machine., We got this as a grad. gift for our grandson. Great price, great laptop & fast delivery!!, Flimsy.  Returned it., Finally unboxed this laptop.. have not used much but the charger that came with it is not original making me think it's a refurbished laptop advertised as 'new' or sent a used one.. will update this review when I've used it a bit..if I don't return it..., It very light weight but not very fast. Screen quality it’s good., Purchased this for a high school kid. Does what it needs to do. The base model is ok. I like that you can upgrade this in the future. They included the bracket for a secondary drive. I will be buying more of these for clients, Works well for school Wish I had read I to description more No sd card or disc reader So cost wasn’t as well as I thought after buying external  readers, Windows does not run as smoothly on the Acer as it did on my Dell. My games do not work as well. Have to refresh page often when searching on internet. Not happy with this product., Can’t complain about an Acer product for the price and quality!, I live everything about it except the battery lifeI constantly has to recharge it to appoint i just kept it plugged most of the time, A good performance., To summarize, you get what you pay for. I was not expecting to run into so many problems right when I took this out of the box.1. Immediately I heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when I pulled it out of its packaging.2. The sound is so bad it's like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store. The speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality.3. Loud fan when it gets a little warm when using.4. Scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs. I had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos I noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs.5. Customer service from both Acer and Amazon makes it difficult to fix your/my issues. I contacted customer service the same day after I received this laptop and also the day after. After telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to Acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed.6. Possible restocking fee. Wanting to return this item, even though I barely used it the first 2 days, customer service told me that I cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it BEFORE they can tell me whether or not I will be charged a restocking fee. If you don't like being surprised by restocking fees, don't buy this laptop so you won't have to return.7, I was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem (basically to spend more money just so I can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file.8. Screen quality is definitely not good. I would give it a 6/10. The color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor, the difference is super noticeable.9. 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me. You would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you're basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usable.I know this has good reviews but don't be fooled by it. I was swayed when I was going through the reviews but after I got my product, I was highly disappointed. I wish I had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop. This one is not worth the regular price. I would say with the issues and quality of this laptop, the price should be around $250., Works fine.  Sound could be louder., I tried 3 of them they perform differently from each other and they appeared to have different hardware suppliers internal parts made by random manufacturers for example M.2 port is only PCIE X2 speed  and advertised internal sata3 port performs about 300mb write and 500mb read on a drive rated 530mb write 550mb read.Over it looks as if it was put together in a hurry debris around plastic body can easily can cut hands skin etc., This laptop is great and I had it for months, but when I first got it I had to pay another 100 dollars to take s mode off of it., The computer itself is great for basic use (checking email, browsing the internet, writing papers, etc). I bought it because I have a MacBook and most Department of Defense websites aren’t compatible with Mac OS. My biggest complaint is that 1 month into owning it, the charging cable doesn’t seem to work anymore and I’m terrified for the day that the battery dies and I have no way of charging it after that., Not good as described. Not hapoy with battery performance., It's a great laptop sometimes it can act a bit uppity but just restart it if you just installed some apps. Also it comes on S mode which you can change to regular windows 10 for FREE!  Go in settings > application > Switch to windows 10 mode, Good laptop but ended returning, found one better., Cheap laptop.  You get what you pay for.  No hard drive.  No cd player.  Mouse board difficult to control., The product key on the laptop was bad and so I could not activate it. Acer customer support was horrible, told me if I had bought it directly from them they could have given me a new product key but since I bought it from Amazon I'm pretty much on my own. Last time I buy this brand., Machine is a really great budget machine. I got it for my wife for school but more than just a throw away machine. In the standard form, it was nothing great. Adding more RAM woke it up a lot. Better overall performance.The back-lit keyboard is huge plus for working at night. Screen resolution and clarity is great as well., I had to return my laptop after the mouse cursor had mysteriously quit working after 3 days of use. While I am used toto Apple products, I tried troubleshooting my Windows laptop, even tried restarting in Safe Mode to troubleshoot, without resolve. I even performed Windows Recovery. Still, no resolve. Confused, I thought, That’s okay, I am within the allotted time to return my laptop. So, I requested a Return and opted for a new replacement (vs. refund). I was careful to ensure I remained in compliance with the Return Policy as set out by Amazon and followed the instructions, step-by-step. I downloaded the RA# and UPS label provided and used it to return my laptop as instructed. The following day, I checked the Amazon website for status of my return, only to discover that all information about my return mysteriously disappeared! I didn’t think much of it as more than a temporary technical error, as it was admittedly nearing the deadline for return. Having carefully followed instructions per Amazon’s Return Policy and with my Proof of Shipment Receipt from UPS, I was confident it would work itself out. NOPE. Evidently not. More than two weeks later, NO REPLACEMENT, NO REFUND, NO RESPONSE. …NO COMMUNICATION. And, Four to Five text messages later to the Seller (via Amazon website) — along w/ submission of my proof of shipment receipt and tracking# — STILL NO RECORD OF iNITIATION OR TRACKING OF MY RETURN. The History of my messages to Amazon / Seller and my Return Request are also *POOF* GONE!What the $&@! NO PHONE NUMBERS; Just the runAround.Apparently, I am now out $500 — AND a laptop. …Fabulous.KNOW THE RISK!, This laptop is 14\"!!! I'm soooo angry!, This laptop is great, its affordable and have a bunch of cool features. The only issue is that it is extremely low. you definitely need a headset or speakers. I have to lift the device to my ears to hear if I dont have any of these available.  I have had it for a year and so far so good., I love it.  Easy to work with, screen is small. whole computer is really a tiny bit larger than a notebook, but the processor is fast and all.. I thought i was upgrading, but i have to wear glasses when using this thing to see the letters., I HAVE ORDERED FOUR ACER LAPTOPS FROM AMAZON IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND LOVE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE BUY A FIFTH ACER LAPTOP, AFTER READING ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS ONE. THEY WERE WRONG AND VERY MISLEADING. I SHOULD HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, THEY WERE ACCURATE. THIS ACER LAPTOP WAS THE WORST, SOUND SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE, YOU CAN BARELY HEAR IT EVEN IF YOU TURN IT UP TO THE MAX, THE MOUSE PAD AND KEYS WERE UNRESPONSIVE, CAN'T ADJUST THE SETTINGS, ETC. I USED IT FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY MINUTES,..... 30 MINUTES  AFTER I CHARGED IT AND I PUT IT RIGHT BACK  IN THE PACKAGING.  I COULD NOT GET IT OUT OF MY HOUSE FAST ENOUGH.  WITHIN AN HOUR, I CALLED AMAZON FOR RETURN AUTHORIZATION TO PICK UP THE LAPTOP THE FOLLOWING DAY.  I GOT MY FULL REFUND, AMAZON'S EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE SAVED THE DAY.  GREATLY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS ACER LAPTOP. BUYER BEWARE., Cons:-over heats-speakers are horrible can barely hear videos (had to install an additional app to make sound louder)-computer lags a bit (shouldn’t lag for the price of it)- not recommend for the pricePros:-Good quality when watching videos etc, I like everything about this computer EXCEPT THE VOLUME-YOU CAN BARELY HEAR ANYTHING ON IT!, dislike the teeny hddlike I can throw an external drive on it and am gtg after taking it OUT of s modenear perfect for my needs and decent price, Not touchscreen as was advertised in the question and answer section. The graphics are so so. Worse than my last Acer. Overall 4 stars., Good computer. I’m using it to create elearning.When I tried to remove the computer from Windows S mode, I realized that the computer did not come with a product key. What this means is in order to remove S mode, you have to buy Windows Home or Pro and use the product key to remove S mode. I wish they would have just told me that! I contacted the company via amazon chat, they said I needed to contact the manufacturer. They gave me a phone number. There is a button on amazon to contact the manufacturer as well. No success.I ended up just buying the downloadable Windows home version and used the product key to remove S mode. I also purchased the microsoft software for powerpoint, word, excel, etc.That's a lot of drama just to be able to download things to my computer. Just know that you are buying a bare bones computer when you purchase., Was a great computer until I had used it twice for Zoom and now the speakers no longer work.  If I figure out why I will update., When I first received this laptop everything seemed great, I was very excited to set it up with my personal information and get going-- I very quickly realized, however, that this computer was EXTREMELY slow for my tastes.  Even with no background programs, simple tasks like opening file explorer or a web browser took far too much time.  In my opinion, a brand new computer should be opening programs almost instantly, not leaving me waiting a few seconds or more.  This is ultimately preference, but I'm sure there are many more laptops out there for a similar price point that would run much faster.  Returned this after only a day or so of having it and ended up with another laptop from the early 2010's and it runs much better than this one., I had this laptop for about 2 months now and I'm loving it so far. It's lightweight, sleek, and the backlit keys are great for me in my dark room. It boots up in seconds ready to go when you turn it on. I mostly use this for watching videos and streams and excels it that. The only negative that I can think of is the placement of the speakers. The speakers are placed on the bottom and really muffle the sound so my volume is always at max. Other than that the laptop is a great budget buy., Displeased. Some black (looks more like green) dotted lines are running down the middle of my screen. Looks like some kind of defect. The laptop was purchased at the start of September and didnt see usage until about the 25th of September, which means In about two months this situation happened. Was satisfied with my purchase before this occurrence., I’m not sure if it has “touch screen”., Poor quality. Cheap, just like the price. Laptop is unlikely to last you long. Charging port was junk.On the positive side, it is very light and small.If you choose to purchase this laptop, best of luck to you., The battery died after a week and the screen started blinking. I needed to connect an external monitor to work. BAD BAD BAD., I was told I was going to get a new battery sent to me because every since I have the laptop it will only turn on if it is plugged in to the wall and i never received a new one.., very cheesy one , keep freezing ,not able open files or photos , not going waste my time to fight that, I love this laptop. The screen is a great size. It’s light weight not heavy and very sleek., Good laptop, I don't do anything out of the ordinary.  Does what a laptop is made to do.  I stayed with ACER because my previous laptop was ACER.  If it didn't lose the 'W' key function I'd still be using it, but would buy a new battery because unless it's plugged in it randomly shuts down, bad battery. So, the new laptop had a new surprise.  The sound volume is very poor.  Now lugging a wifi speaker along wherever the laptop goes.  I have to not recommend for this very reason., Absolute garbage, I really dont write reviews but when I do I usually make them for the people this laptop is good when it works but I only used this about 10 times and now it does not charge or turn on pretty much got robbed I'm really disappointed I was really hyped about this product but no durability whatsoever no scratch or anything looks brand new and it's a lemon buyers beware., Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop 15.6 inches Full HD computer stop working this month July 2021.  I purchase this item in October 2020 as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  Unfortunately, the computer has stop working and the battery will not charge.  Please contact me in reference to the warranty information.  I would not purchase another computer through AMAZON.  No customer service support when needed., bought this for my brother laid up with back surgery-easy to work great graphics and definitely user friendly!, All ok so far, cute unit--but does not work after two hours =  black screen & deadmay i have a replacement unit?, I love this computer, but the mouse pad doesn’t work. Had to buy a wireless mouse to even use it. But otherwise great product, Good quality, use it to work from home and meetings and classed., I faced several issues with this PC in spite on light usage. First google meet does not work on all browsers and suddenly mutes the conversation. We spent ages trying to solve this problem until we discovered that it works only on microsoft edge.Sound quality is not clear and low.Finally the battery stopped charging and the laptop does not work except when it is plugged in power. All of this happened after less than 8 months of usage.A total waste of money, The product arrived with a bad wireless card. I returned the item and the refund was applied to a Amazon gift card instead of my credit card. I am not happy., I’ve had this computer for a year and for some reason the computer won’t work unless it’s plugged in. I originally got it for college, but the pandemic caused me to stay and do school at home. I haven’t spilled anything or dropped the computer so I don’t know what the problem is., Nice PC but the backlighting went out after 3 weeks and Acer couldn't help me. Having a laptop without being able to see the keys is not good., Bought one year ago, already falling apart. Lacks durability.  Good for a few months, then you'll need a new one.  The input to the power cord is broken and now the laptop won't charge.  The lever that opens and closes the laptop pulled apart. Stay away.  Terrible quality., I baught this laptop and after just a month and a half the mouse pad won't work. Scam, ALL ELSE OK, I regret buying this laptop and spending all the extra money in shipping.I am having two major troubles with this laptop:1 - The laptop slows down and lags badly once unplugged from power. It runs fast and fine when plugged. It's so bad. I have gone to Control panel and under power settings created a different profile for high performance and gone to advanced power settings and set everything to high performance and still the issue persists.I upgraded the RAM to 16GB. Same issue. I have done countless troubleshooting as seen on different websites, my windows is updated. I have switched off most background and start-up apps and it's still same. I just don't understand why I can't have the freedom to use my laptop at high performance when unplugged. This is crazy. I'm suspecting AMD and Acer to be behind this. This issue sometimes doesn't happen but most times it does.2. Second issue is that when connected to hotspot, this device will from time to time shut off internet connection for not obvious reason.So I could be in the middle of an important zoom meeting and off she goes.Don't buy this if you want peace of mind. The back cover also is inferior plastic., Considering I had a Toshiba laptop for over 10 years with no problems, I expected better of this. But two months into it the touch pad and cursor died. Fortunately I still had the wireless mouse and keyboard so the laptop is still functional.I don't have the time or patience to fool around with a return. When I buy a product I expect it to work. We'll see how long it lasts., Track pad broke within 1 month of use. Amazon was no help., Extremely happy with this. I have a laptop i can take on the go for long business trips even upgraded the ram to make it even better. Glad i found this.   \n",

battery life is about 7 hours of constant use games videos etc sounds is good i had no problems connecting to internet the border of the phone did appear to have some scratches but not too many the phone i received has a loose charging port that should have been replaced it was at 27 just now and i plugged it in and opened an app now it just gave me the under 20 notification so it is obviously struggling to keep the cord in place no working well cannot download any apps horrible phone my old android works better than this junk please refund money diana manuele it is for personal and the battery life issues is crazy it is only take 2 hours worked slow barely charged battery life is not good at all only last an hour the worse i never bought battery is dead and i sent it in africa so no way to return it just lost my money i could give 0 star i am very picky with my phone cases which means i keep buying them until i find one that is jut right this phone case has everything i am looking for it is not to bulky and has a slim fit it is enclosed and has a built in screen protector the front plastic trim does not cover top and bottom front of the like some cases making the screen appear smallerthe rubber is stiff and durable and not like those cheap ones the stretch out over timeone reviewer stated they had to keep taking it apart to get the moister out well this is not a waterproof case and if it was it would be heavier and bulkier i am wondering how that much moister is getting in ther in the 1st place are you bathing with it tip instead of drenching the phone with cleaning solution then wiping it up try spraying the cleaning solution on the rag itself just enough to coat it then use that to clean the screenanother reviewer stated the back falls off if you do not snap it in correctly this will happen solution go to an arts and crafts store or fabric store and ask for some double sided hem tape it is very thin and extremely strong it will keep that back on if it is a defect phone broke a little after a month was only given a small back on return and was never told why after multiple emails do not buy phone appeared to be flawless when it arrived it stopped recognizing any sim card after 3 months even though it was a few days out of warranty when it died the seller still took it back for a full refund too small in size the phone looks great however the battery life was 70 instead of the promised 80 this means that the battery dies very quickly even when fully charged we attempted to contact the seller but received no response we would have settled for an exchange but again no response looks like we have to buy a battery add another 50 to the price to get a fully refurbished phone very disappointed hey it is an iphone i did have to buy ear buds for this unit as none came with itthe phone is ok but the battery is horrible gsm does not work this version of iphone cannot be repaired i stop being able to update because it does not connect to the local network it is without service that is now it helps me to connect only by wifi and to listen to music battery drains from 100 to 0 in 2 hours of use the battery is at 50 i mean impossible to use it lousy purchase they should withdraw it from circulation to these iphone 7 phone came in on 86 battery life and touch screen does not like to work would not recommend this phone phone works great but battery needs replacement per the iphone settings screen just over 3 months after purchase does not hold charge for long even with all settings optimized not using gps in background etc otherwise price was reasonable the phone battery was supposed to be at 80 or better but this battery only 77 and apple saying need to replace battery now it is too bad vendors do not install new batteries and increase the price because changing these batteries is not fun as you can have screen damage and broken wires aside from that very happy with phone and fast delivery good condition but instantly overheats when charge not sure if that is normal but the body of it great condition this iphone 7 gets really hot as soon as you charge it also it charges slow the phone is unlocked no scratches no flaws came right on clear packaged for fragile item very well my daughter loves her new phone it is hard to buy from a third party and it not working is frustrating my review is half bad and half good it came in almost a week which i was crazy waiting for it i was so happy when it got here i checked the battery capacity and it only charges to 62 which was so disappointing it charges really fast but loses a lot of percent quick other than that everything was good it came with a charger and charger block i ordered from trademore to get a refurbished iphone 7 and it arrived fully ready to go out of the box with the latest ios version installed all i needed to do was add in my sim chip and sign on with my apple id and icloud backup restore did the rest the unit i received works like new and was actually flat as opposed to some other refurbs i have had it had some scratching on the glass but not over the actual display area trademore and amazon refurbs may seemed more expensive than refurbs from elsewhere but it is worth it for a great unit with no hassles or technical gotchas it took a while for this to become an issue at first i was restarting the phone which i thought was fixing the problem but the proximity sensor does not function properly as a result when i attempt to talk on a call the screen remains lit and the side of my face continually hits the buttons resulting in frustration for both me and the caller it is impossible to hold a voice call at this point unfortunately by the time i realized what the problem is the phone is not eligible for a refund easy to use i got my iphone 7 opened it was fine owner did not factor reset it i turned it on an it was on home screenworks well i like it 810 batter health was at 70 not the promised 80 bad phones you are not honest i bought this for a july gift it stopped working 8 months later it would no longer receive a cellular signal it took about a week to troubleshoot with the mobile carrier before they said it must be your phone i took it to a phone repair shop and they said the motherboard crashed so i got this phone when it originally came it had more damage than what was listed so i returned it the next one that came in had little to no damage so i was excited however after the 30 day return window of course the phone has been having all sorts of problems i have audio issues with my phone on speaker the keyboard gets stuck constantly and the battery life is pretty much nonexistent incredibly pissed i bought this for 230 and now can only get 60 if i sell it back just a warning but if you buy your phone from here you are gambling with your money honestly so just do a payment plan through your provider or get it from apple and spare yourself the frustration died every 20 minutes and constantly shut off and if it was colder than 50 degrees it would not turn on i am disappointed with this phones battery life i have to make sure i keep a charger with me everywhere i go this is my first experience with an iphone so maybe that is how they are i do not know this was in good condition and battery life good seller guarantees 80 battery received phone with battery capacity of only 75 seller never replied to follow up messages and only offered a 20 credit and never replied when alternatives were requested bought this refurbished iphone for our daughter we like the parental controls that apple offers we are not going to buy her a new expensive phone so it is nice to get a used one from amazon overall good product the cameras kind of glitches at times but it overall works the battery dies very quickly but it works perfectly fine even without a sim card very good product i just got this for my middle school son in time for school to start it needed charging upon arrival but the charging cordplug that came with it did not work luckily this is a replacement phone and we have other chargers in the house and so were able to get it chargedit is working so far i cannot comment on battery life yet because it is too soon the phone appeared to be in excellent condition overall satisfied with iphone 7 transaction the phone arrived in pristine physical conditioni could not find a scratch on itthe battery however had 78 capacity not the 80 advertised not sure it would have made a difference as this phone was for my 12 year old son and in the end i decided to replace the battery which granted is not for everyone as it is not a 5minute process more like an hour and 44 minutes processwas able to successfully change the battery and all is well so netnet was able to get a likenew iphone 7 for under 200recommend this vendor but do know if you are not comfortable swapping in a new battery you will be charging your phone 23 times a day as normal phone usage will deplete the battery quickly i like everything i do not dislike nothing fine i like is because it was a easy set up and everything was good on it i have to go to apple because i got this phone for verizon and it will not let me make calls or texts sooooo basically do not buy it i was pleasantly surprised after reading a few notsogood reviews but the iphone 7 verizon that i received looked like it was brand new it was packaged very nicely in a custom box with a new charging cable and ac converter not a single scratch on it battery health was rated at 84 and everything worked perfectly frankly i cannot imagine why someone actually traded this in for a new phone but i am glad they did my daughter currently my tech support person was sweet enough to get me a very nice youmaker protector for it she knows i am a bit clumsy i have only had this phone for a few weeks but so far so good i even use it for visual control fpv on a few of my quadsdrones it is remarkable how well the battery holds up for that video on 1015 minute flights much better than my old iphone very glad i bought this runs slow colabirtation is off and screen glitches battery life is insufficient and less than expected phone came fast and everything is good but the battery only holds a charge for about an hour when it is not charging pretty annoyed about this bad battery life junk charger just buy new instead of having to do it anyways home button non functional was not bad came in good condition if i can fit everything i did not like about this phone into this box i would detail itbut whoever replaced the screen did a horrible jobwont register any sim cards to any carrierit looks like i bought it from wishcom there is a black line when trying to take pictures takes horrible pictures the phone is used and it does not earphones everything was great like brand new like many read a lot of bad reviews was worried that there would be major issues upon getting the phone however my phone showed up next day super fast opened up the packaging and the iphone 7 looked very very good couple very tiny scuffs but was expecting such as it is a used phone would give it a 910 and i am picky called my phone provider and they were able to switch it to my number no problem i have sprint which has merged with t mobile i got the fully unlocked phone for anyone wondering after running the phone through all its tests everything is in proper working order battery life is at 84 which is fine by me higher than the stated number of 80 anyways never really payed attention to that stuff on the other phones i have had all i can say is that the phone is doing everything it should and i am very happy with it if there is one concern the phone may be running a hair warm but nothing to seem worried about momentarily i will update this post at any point in the next 6 months if need be but so far so good company i went with tech exchangee ny screen had a small crack and a chip and the back has some marks on it and the home button is difficult to make contact however the phone does work cord does not work this device only worked for 6 months and it started decaying i send it to apple and they stated that it will need a new motherboard this was for personal use the phone has been nothing but trouble since the day we got it will not make calls or will make calls on its own we do not even when we are not even trying need to know if there is insurance on this purchase or is there any kind of warranty on this purchase item came without a charger i have been using my phone for about a month from what i have been able to assess so far the phone has been working properly the battery holds fairly well unless playing a game on the phone it drains the battery pretty quickly the siri function the finger print unlock and camera are pretty amazing and they are some of the many things that i did not have on my iphone 4so this is a wonderful upgrade for me very average product must have been used for couple of years before reselling it battery life was at 80 when arrived good purchase if one wants to buy iphone at cheap price phone works great i have to say no problems so far 55 have this phone just over six months it glitches turns off all the time battery drains fast phone will not shut off even when the battery is at 98 the amount of money i spent on it i should have gotten more than 6 months use would not recommend the phone barley work cannot call nobody cannot text nobody why it dies so fast it is ok it is a good phone over all but often freezes or hangs up calls on its own dies very fast annoying the stop working in 2 weeks extremely scratched and banged up should not have passed quality control unless the standards are that low perfect condition the battery on my other phone was only lasting me from 7 am 1 pm so i figured i would get a new phone the new phone is lasting from 7 am 11am and says the battery is 100 healthy worst purchase ever do not waste time on this item does not even turn on turns mad hot 1st day on arrival does not turn on 2nd day return hopefully all turn out good with money back update later on phone has no signal antenna broke internally on phone within 4 months just outside the 3 month return window worked great until then i liked it except for the fact that the back had some dints in it and you cannot turn it on silent mood look good speaker are not working arrived a day early which is usually nice but i planned my schedule around it arriving on the estimated delivery date it had obvious wear on the back and there was a small blotch on the screen that must have been dead pixels or something because it was pure white regardless of what was on the screen i did not like it in this condition so i returned it and they said they would deduct return shipping cost from my refund but they ended up not doing that the phone i received did not have a working microphone could not record or make calls the company issued me a full refund they have great customer service but sold a faulty device so i gave a neutral rating honestly i was so nervous to buy a phone from amazon for the 7 year old stepson but reviews can be very deceiving phone worked great now if i can only get this 7 year old to come back to earth and stay off the phone lol needles to say he loves it the phone does not work i can hear a person i call but they cannot hear me i loved this phone for about a half a year and loved it however i got a message saying my sim card could not be read turns out that this is a known iphone mistake when iphones are built when i brought it to the apple store they said that because it was originally made in japan they could not fix it or send me a new one i am now out for a new phone however it worked very well when it did i just would not risk it my battery dies way too soon the package also arrived much later than expected and also had a decent scratch in the screen deep enough to affect the overall appearance the camera works just as expected but it definitely was not the new look you can definitely see the precious wear and tear on the iphone no work for verizon great phone thank you i was confused by the packet i received with item it said iphone 5s i was ready to returni am a new iphone user i was kind of disappointed with charger not working had to buy additional one to use phone overall its a great item the phone was very nice looking phone but i had to return the phone due to it was not compatible with my sprint network service the phone constantly restarts itself the battery lasts all of 10 minutes i do not recommend buying a phone from this company they are junk i have only had this iphone 7 a few days the reason i bought it is because my previous iphone would not hold a charge for more than a few hours so far this iphone will hold a charge for 2 days with moderate use i am happy with it so far the charger that came with it did not work but i still have my previous iphone charger that did work other than that i am happy with it it did not have any scratches or anything and looks brand new this review is for the seller hybrid it first of all i was not expecting it to come as fast as it did i ordered my phone friday at 3 am and received it saturday by 12 pm that is kind of insane since they are in ny and i am in fl there are a few small scuffs on the bottom of the device near the speaker but otherwise it is pretty close to perfect cosmetically the screen has no scratches at all i cannot tell if it is the original but if it was replaced they did a hell of a job the max battery capacity is 100 it came with a charger but no headphones or headphone adapter so you will need to buy one i have not experienced any issues so far but it is only been a day so i will make sure to come back and give an updatealso if you have metro by tmobile and you are having trouble getting service after inserting your sim you have to register the phone with them before it will work not sure about other carriers for a second i thought i received a lockedstolen phone but i wanted to make sure do not give up unless the carrier actually tells you it will not work you can try calling the customer service number and doing it with the automated system or a representative but if you do not have access to your old phone you need to go into the store it took 5 minutes and only costs 1520 depending on where you liveoverall i am extremely pleased it was a risk but i am happy i seem to have gotten a good device thankful for all the reviews recommending to buy from this seller the maximum capacity of the battery was on 74 when i received the phone i can only use the phone for a few hours before the battery is completely dead other than them sending it with a bad battery the phone works great do not buy this phone i got this in today after looking for a good phone for my son for about 2 months the home button did not work and you cannot use verizon it is not amazon renewed its a scam phone is ok no marks or scratches but came with outdated ios that needed to be updated prior to transferring data from old phone battery life is not great there are times when a phone is set to support another carrier and even after a full factory reset any carrier update will kill your mobile network happened to me sprinttmobile reset it and tried multiple times and every time we got it to work it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a daythat means no calls no text no internet if you are outside of wifibe warned and keep your old phone handy you may be disappointed like i was every renewed phone i have gotten before this one had a renewed battery this one did not will have to get one soon phone charge only last a few hours would not have bought it if i would have known the battery was not renewed ok it was good phone till a month after purchase kind of salty about it still wish i did not spend on the phone also did not come with the right charger i like the condition of the phone it really looks as good as newthe problem is on the earphones plug should provide the adapter the phone was ok i had a few issues but nothing major gof a great product fast response phone worked great for about 6 months then it stopped connecting to the cellular service trying to update it and the phone says that i cannot called apple support and they cannot do anything since phone is no longer under warranty everything was good except the battery came to me at 80 capacity so when it charges to it is never better than 80 the seller offered me a 2000 credit but i cannot find an authorized dealer to change the battery this phone is almost perfect the only thing about this device is that i cannot get it turned on due to the fact that it will not accept a sim card i found this misleading due to the fact that they told me my device was renewed and compatible with certain carriers nice piece my son loves it arrived quick looks new works great he is been smiling since received the phone in the usual blank white box refurbs come in shipping was fast and it came with an android charger block and a no name lightning cablephone came with one long deep scratch a cracked home button and a couple other much smaller nicks and scratches enough that it was off putting for me battery life showed 92 which is excellent however the phone did seem to lag after only my second week with itphone was unlocked as stated and i had no issues switching in my sim and using the phone right away overall a decent phone but i will be returning it because of the the cracked touch id button and deep scratches the phone does not work properly it heats up so hot every time we try and use it gift good condtion a good way to get a new iphone at a good price the battery is useless it takes 3 hours of use to fully recharge needs to be replaced all seemed as expected from the seller and from description except battery life was not 80 or above as stated in listing but 70the biggest issue with this was having to pay send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promisedthis just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending then what else are they not checking with these phones did not come with any kind of paperwork and it is working but the touchscreen can freeze up at times although i was very happy to get a much needed upgrade from my old 5s and this was just the right size there were a couple of things i was not satisfied with and almost sent the phone back first of all amazon stated the battery would be able to be charged at a minimum of 80 its original capacity mine was not it was around 75 i figured ok well i suppose i could live with that but amazon also states that there will be no visible blemishes on the phone viewed from 12 inches that was not the case with mine the finish on one of the rear corners about a half inch the entire corner of the phone was completely wore off once again i decided i could live with that since it is the rear and would be covered with the case overall i am happy with the speed and functionality of the phone though and the screen camera and everything work great i am not happy that i will end up putting another 50 to 100 dollars into a phone that cost me about 200 in order to get a new full capacity battery that lasts longer for media and extended use daughter loves it no fingerprints reader and the phone glitches a lot i was switching phones because the one i was using had a battery that was starting to die however this one does just as quickly and got so hot it almost hurt to hold it i just opened this product and charged it fully for two hours and unplugged it as i am sitting here on my old phone to port over my sim card credentials the battery went from 100 to 88 within 8 minutes i just saw the numbers dropping right before my eyes the phone transfer and condition are really good but the battery is terrible i wish the guarantee included a new battery health is reading at 83 out of the box the phone is very small battery life not as advertised only 56no answer from seller the phone looked good function well but was defective it had something loose inside and i had return it i would definitely buy again this the real deal fr you all should try them out i got my moneys worth the battery life last about 2 to 3 hours great phone defiantly recommend it is a little weird at times like it takes a while to turn on after it dies sometimes and i cannot have certain pictures as my screensaver for some reason it would black out parts of it but i only had that problem with two of my pictures other than that for a refurbished phone it is pretty good i have boughten iphones from amazon before two different iphone 6s this time i could only find iphone 7 so if figured why not i will tell you why this seller sent a defective phone it worked perfectly the first day and then 24 hours later it told me i needed to update it or else my cellular data would not work which means i could not receive or send any texts or calls sure enough i updated it and it worked for another few hours until it said it needed another update unfortunately it was already up to date as it could be so i took it in to the geniuses at apple and they said this is a common problem with iphone 7 you need to replace it and that was it returning hopefully that goes smoothly avoid iphone 7 too sketchy excellent product  \n",

top coats work great for an at home gel manipedi my only issue was when i tried to soak and scrape it off it seemed like the base layer bonded almost too well with my nail and part of my nail layers scraped off i had to take a few months break between the next gel manicure because my nails were damaged this could just be user error or the fact that my nails are extremely thin they held up great though and looked beautiful the product works great the only reason i did not give five stars was because it smells terrible like a skunk almost and it is very strong but it works and works well i would buy it again beats having to use nail polish remover in the end best quality i have ever used at home nails come out looking professional very easy to use i recommend it smells awful while the polish is great every bottle i have ever had from them 4 all have leaked when on their side i love this product it is very easy and it last for 14 days best brand for top coat and base my favorite one terrible product the base coat seemed to work fine but the top coat was in such a gellike consistency that i could not even use it no matter how hard i shook the bottle up it remained the same waste of money only reason i gave it two stars instead of one is because the base coat worked all in all not happy the base coat is horrible you are better off just buying the top coat only top coat is average i would say i have done my manicures without the base and they come out better the base causes the polish to look bumpy really cool that i can do this at home just light and done my top coat bottle came completely empty i am returning for a replacement but it is disappointing poor quality was only good the first few uses base coat became thick and does not go on smoothly at all product quality changes over very short time would not recommend both me and my sister are allergic to this product after some use it causes nail bed pain and inflammation it is great that you take a picture but it helps if you show the door this was dropped off at 104 not 106 i could not get the base coat to dry fully i used my uv light 5 times 5 min and it was still tacky i gave up and went ahead and put polish over it anyway the polish i used thankfully was able to dry just fine the top coat seemed to dry much better but i will not be using this brand again overall this is a good set it can be thick so be sure to wipe the brush on the side of the bottle before applying and when covering your nail make sure to use thinner coats and apply evenly or else you will see the linesuneven levels after curingfor curing times i have a uv led lamp and was not sure how long to cure for top coat 60 seconds is perfect cures hard and comes off easily when time to remove for base coat i tried 60 seconds but was having a hard time when removing it so i went down to 30 seconds and that seems to have helped top coat dried out in the bottle after 3 uses returned perfect bottles came leaking from the top the gel polish i got to go along with these two bottles was perfectly fine and intact why these leaked i do not know i have not used them yet either since most of the product was all over the box it came in top coat goes on nicely and leaves a nice shinny coat and is not sticky pretty easy to come because the polish came off within a week i would have expected it to last at least 2 weeks very small but not too bad nice not that good this product worked amazingly well after a minute under led uv it was dry very sheer and worked well with my polygel kit first time trying this brand and my last very very thin like a refusal polish not hard at all nails broke easily i do not recommend this brand great product amazing lasts the longest out of anything i have tried this is a peel off formula i do follow all the instructions for application and i never use acetone to remove i soak in water for a few minutes or just hand wash some dishes and i am able to peel of the polish most times i one piece now while that its awesome because it removes easily the manicure does not last past 2 days with out major chipping i used it the first time and it worked real good but the second time was horrible i could not get it to set correctly it was in a way clumpy it sucks because i really wanted to like it horrible product does not stay on the top coat has a thick glue like consistency and does not spread on nail well peels off within a couple of days so disappointed is just a oil it is clumpy and did not even dry all the way through now my nails are smudgedestá muy gruesa y no se secaron bien mis youñas i ordered the base top coat about 4 years ago i loved it i started doing my own nails again so i wanted to try it againbad idea the base coat works fine but the top coat started clumping was too thick this was only the first use maybe they have changed the polish since the last time i used it but i will not be ordering it again works fine does not last too long though the base coat good but the top coat is trash starts peeling the next day great base and tip coat lasts atleast 3 weeks for me not even an ounce i have tried various steps in an effort to get this polish to last longer than 7 days it does not matter what i do it chips and looks like crap and has to be changed by day 7 i bought this base and top with amelie gel polish the topcoat got extremely clumpy after the second use causing an unsmooth finish i was super excited to get my gel polishes in with such fantastic ratings unfortunately the product was so thick when i went to apply it applied like a literal paste there is no good use for this polish and i would like a refund promptly i love the no wipe too coat saves me some time this brand does not hold up the shellac peels off a lot sooner then expected seriously soooo good i do my own gel nailstoes at home and this is by far the best set i have gotten gel polish is definitely an art and takes a long time to master if this set lifts you probably just are not doing your gel application correctly these two are excellent also added bonus you do not need to wipe the top coat the item itself is good but the bottles are very very tiny i wish they made them a little bigger for the price this does what it says it will do and the top coat is not sticky at all when it sets the only complaint i have is that if you try to close the bottle when there is polish on the brush and the polish gets onto the mouth of the bottle the cap will actually shrink wrap onto the mouth of the bottle making it very hard to open this has happened to me several times so now i make sure there is no polish on the outside of the mouth of the bottle and i try to close it very gently not tightly please be aware of how you close this nail polish otherwise it will take forever to open when you want to use it again i really loved this product for the first few months but recently began to have an allergic reaction to the product i am bummed i have to switch it up now because its great quality not saying do not buy it but definitely be mindful very good product will buy again applies and cures well but dulls your manicure significantly also the base coat is difficult to remove bought for my sister who does nails and she did not like it sadly i like the product it is a good shine and it lasts about two weeks i was pleased the gel has a murky purple coating during the day time it glows green under uv light when comparing this top coat to my kupa inc top coat there is a huge difference in color kupa inc top coat is clear and the aimeli has the murky purple coating so in love with this gel it is thick and gets into all the nooks and crannies it was actually recommended by a nail tech on you tube nailed by nikki and i had to try so far i am loving this product if you do not like thick gel this is not for you but trudt you will not regret this buy top coat does not wear well base coat works great dislike great base and top coat for gel nails not bad i have ordered it several times wish they would sell a matte top gel with these too i was scared at first because it was still tacky after curing under uv light but i read it is supposed to be so polish will stick continued with my nail routine and it turned out well really great product especially for the price great for beginners works well i brought the polish the size of the bottle for what you pay is pretty small i do not blink your eyes this chips and peels off about like regular nail polish it is nothing like gel nails that you get in the salon which is what i was looking for top coat turns yellow after a few days i have used the base and top coat 4 times so far and every time my nails start turning yellow after a few days i have tried different curing times and even wiped the top coat after but nothing seems to fix it this has never happened with other brands of gel top coat i have used worked pretty good good product for the price i usually get opi but this did the job this was great for the price only issue was it did chip in some nails but that may have been true to operator error i may not have cured the polish long enough all in all i am happy with my purchase also arrived a lot sooner than i had anticipated this i cannot even begin this is an amazing base and top coat my nails lasted it was easy to use and great for gelsi love it this is my first gel base and top coat so i really do not have anything to compare it to this must be a cheaper brand or the base coat is just bad i have been using file off gel polish and i was noticing that i have a problem not damaging my nail when filing it off it was not killing my nails but i figured soak off would case me to do less accidental damagei bought this brand because it was prime available and somewhat inexpensive in a week i have had two nails one on each hand peel completely off its not like the free edge got loose it just was really lifted in the middle or edge where it frowns in and the loose polish would get peeled up to an awkward place where i had to remove it or it would peel even more off the top layer of my nails one happened in just 3 days three days i fixed those two jankity nails and i also added a second coat of just the top coat to all of my nails after 1 week i cannot tell if the top coat is better or notnow this does have a perk its super easy to soak off and remove like wow it removes like butter but if its coming off super easy because it falls off of a well prepped nail in less than a week this is a problem i can now see why this has some lower ratings and why people would spend at least double on a widely known us name brand will i use the rest of teh bottle yes i am cheap i also like changing my nail polish color frequently if i can pull that off this soaks off so easy that i could totally change my polish all the time but it also just falls off which means when i am too busy to do a manicure once a week this just flat out sucksedit i have updated this review because after sitting and soaking off the polish i am really happy with how my nails look they are not damaged or sad looking it really did just bubble up and off this would not be my choice for wearing before going on vacation or trying to wear for weeks in a row since it does not bubble up and come off easily but if you like to change your nail color a couple of times a week you will be happy with this polish88 update i keep trying this basetop coat foolishly because i have it it keeps performing poorly polish just pops off within a day or two of application just spend more and get gelish even with shrinkage at least it stays on the nail better its my own fault for trying it again but good grief peels easy this basecoat is whack upon applying it it is separated like crazy when i applied my gel color over top it also would separate on top until the second or third layer when it evened out the topcoat is great not tacky once it is been cured and works as advertised top coat and base coat is very thick hard to apply thin took forever to cure and was sticky had to put under the led light a lot longer than suggested to cure and then my thumb completely peeled off this is the worst gel i have ever used does not really fully harden peels off not durable at all do not reccommend not good do not buy this this item is a great price for the two bottles and it a product that i like because of the no wipe top coat and it give a nice shiny finish easy to use and has a nice longevity impressed with the quality not so well i used this base and top coat with the gellen polish brand this stuff works great top coat is very glossy and dries fast with the uv lamp like instantly dry i have had these nails for 2 weeks and the gloss wore off a smidge but that is expected after 2 weeks still has not chipped or lost all glossiness i recommended this brand to 2 friends overall great purchase i will be buying the colors next i am reasonably new to gel nails and this was my first set of top and base which i bought as amazon reccommended it i am fully aware of how long it takes to remove gel but this stuff does not come off an hour of working at it every manicure with sandpaper bowls of acetone and wraps and it just does not budge yet it manages to lift along my cuticle line after a week and a half buy something higher quality and experiment with inexpensive gel colors lesson learned i do like this but do not get to close to the sides of your nail it will peel up i can get it to last 7 to 10 days so i guess it is not to bad its not easy to take off unless it is peeling up i am by no means a pro with my nails so it could totally be something that i am doing wrong but for the price it is not a bad product great quality for the price convenient that you do not have to use rubbing alcohol after use my nails stay on really well using the base and top coat used with uv light look nice but the nail polish only last like 4 days liked this product and the cost is fair i have used name brands that have cost more and this brand is equivalent bottles were broken at the cap bottles spilled out the contents was not able to be used very disappointed this is my favorite base top coat set i definitely wish that they made bigger bottles or maybe a refill bottle because i literally have to order a new set every week i go through them too quickly and having the option to just refill my bottle would be so amazing i really like this base top coat but it does leave almost a blue tint to the polish sometimes or it can be streaky i am new to the diy uv lamp this is a must have for uv gel make sure your nails are clean and dry before you put the base coat wiping with alcohol works well would recommend and buy again not a big fan of this the base coat never dries which i know is kind of okay because it is a base coat but overall it just takes forever under the lamp and by that time things like dust get stuck in the polish so it is weird was old really smooth and shiny but it has a really strong smell bought for a friend and she said it is the best she is used this far i will stick to the beetles brand but it is good to know there is an alternative that works well if necessary good this top coat sucks it gets so cloudy and it does not shine i bought this as my first gel base and top coat polish lasted the average two week which was great however no matter how careful i applied it it always left imperfections like it shrinks when it sets up under the light perfect and smooth going on ripples when dried i tried it with many different colorsbrands and always got the same result i will stick to my new favorite cnc shellac perfect every time used it twice by the second time the product had already become a useless gooey substancewaste of money i work whole day and full time mom and this works great lasts 10 days easy to apply received today and not sure if this is oldproduct but i cannot get the top coat bottle open not sure but it is definitely defective you need the no wipe top for any of their polishes i use plenty top coat but this is the worst by far works great pretty nice polish after using this product as instructed i realized that the topcoat comes off way too easy i am not happy with it i do like the builder gel but other than that i do not like this product my base coat takes a longer time to dry other than that will by again love the colors but peels off ez on natural nails this set is really nice and works well for acrylic nails be warned that on natural nails the top coat burns when cured otherwise this product is awesome trash i love the base and top coat the only problem i have had is that the top coat came really lumpy but i have been working through it and just wiping the clumps off as i work but over all they are both great and last i love how it goes oni got so excited i ordered morebut it chips after a few daysam so very disappointed in thatwould not buy againnow that i already have bought it as a result of all them better tthan positive reviews i was not at all disappointed definitely recommended with no reservations long lasting but a few cons the product is very runny so you have to be careful otherwise you will have a lot of clean up around your cuticles to do before curing i did not have issues with peeling or chipping until a couple weeks later so that is a plus the biggest con for me was the removal i am not sure this is really soak off i soak cotton balls in 100 pure acetone and wrap in foil after 40 minutes only the top coat budged a little my gel polish another brand peeled off very easily but underneath the base coat was hard as a rock this is the same thing that happens when i use my regular gel polish top coat and forget that it has to filed off and accidentally soak them i love a good base and top coat but i do not want it to be so thick this product is much thicker than any i have used so far and i had a lot of bubbling on my nail and for these reasons i am passing on future purchases i have been using these for years seems like the formula changed lately less shiny does not have the same look under the led light not sure how it will hold up top coat was clumpy purchased 2 x happened to both top coats the top coat was not going on well i had to replace the top coat with a different brand but i still use the base coat the base coat works quite well difficult to remove it though but after 1 or 2 uses the top coat does not work very well at all it bubbles like crazy leaving a polka dot texture and my nails start chipping after 4 or 5 days of wear would not recommend functionally decent they smell atrocious though more so than any nail product i have smelled in my life acrylic smells better than this stuff it is like burning plastic straight from the bottle needs over 60 seconds under uv to set but that is not a huge deal i do not know what i have been doing wrong if anything but the base coat cures in a weird way it will almost bubble and shrink to one side of my nail i thought it was my technique or lamp but i later found out it was not the case the top coat is pretty solid though so i will keep using that i was so excited about finding a cheaper alternative to the sally hansen brand but the first time i stuck my hands in any water the top coat chipped right off and looked awful also took a long time to cure it is cheap but you should probably just pay a bit more for a better top coat nice gel as expected applies well dries well with my lamp is no wipe my only complaint is that it does not get thick or strong enough this product works for maybe a day or 2 but after that it peels off or chips easily so with that being said it definitely easy to remove lol would recommend just spending the money on a better product that might cost more you will save yourself time i have had these for some time now i do prefer this formula over other brands however after using for a while the outside of the bottles gets extremely sticky there is still plenty of polish left over in the bottle so i hate to throw it away but i might have to replace them because i cannot stand the feeling other than that everything is great just make sure that you keep them upright all the time and be careful when using this is amazing product love this product works great cures in 30secs would recommend 2 anyone who wants stronger lasting nails polish started chipping on day 1 to be fair it may have been the uv lamp i was using because i think it was defective hence the extra 2 stars i love that you do not have to wipe the topcoat but no matter how long i soak my nails the basecoat will not come off i have excellent soak off fingernail polish remover but the basecoat will not come off all of the way i am going to have to sand it off my nails wow this stuff lasts a very long time however it took me 3 separate times of soaking my nails with acetone to remove the top coat at 20 minutes each time i buffed my nails first to scratch it too it might be easier to let the polish grow out the top coat polish keeps its shine for entire time this stuff lasts a long timethe base coat did not even come off so i just buffed it off with my nail filei want to give this a great review the price is so good it is just so darn hard to remove i like the other polish colors but just will use my other brand base and top coats instead polish was awful it was thick and difficult to apply because it did not flow from the brushit globbed i did use the curing lightthinking it might kind of smooth out a bit and it took 45 mins supposed to take one minute to make it seem ok but it never did completely dry huge waste of my money and my time the top coat is amazing i love it the base coat is weird minus a star you have to put a super even coat on the whole nail and it cannot be too thin of a layer because it becomes uneven you have to use just the right amount anyway it makes me wonder if the base coat is even necessary also the base coat does not dry hard after the lamp it is a bit sticky so do not touch it that is supposedly normal though i have mixed feelings about this product the first time i used the polish it was amazing but the next time i used it it was like the top coat was settinghardening on the brush i pulled that clump off and then went on it worked just as the first time but then when i go to use it the 3rd time there is little hard pieces all over the brush the was no sticky film once you cure it under the light i just wish i for more uses out of it rather than looking like 3 i have used many gel polishes but this is the first to do this i may have gotten a bad batch or something i really like the base coat i have had no problem with the my polish coming off of my nail sticky very sticky i do not feel like it is quite as shiney as previous ones i have purchased pretty good once dry there are no problems with chipping or peeling but need to take extra time under the uv lamp i have used two different brand lamps and both take a while to dry so be patient and you have a great polish i have used several different base and top coats but when i used this one it started peeling off after 3 days nice shine but that is a bummer does not stay on really shiny easy to use but for some reasons it turns yellow after a couple days 34 i have been sandwhiching my my old polish with great success lasts over a week i have not waited for it to chip to removei do not notice any funky smell like other reviewersi have to say though the base coat is difficult to remove i have to do a second round of buffing and soaking to get it off and still have to buff of the remnantsps you have to let your nail polish dry before you put on the top coat or it will never dry will buy again leaked everywhere such a mess had to throwaway very disappointed in this product i have used a better top and base coat in the past and repurchased those instead i missed the cut off to return it but i honestly would it did not last more than a week this base coat was unbelievably bad it applied smoothly to freshly washed cleaned nails that had been wiped clean of residue with alcohol then as it cured it drew together into raised rivulets leaving other parts of the nails completely bare it also went spiky with little points all over it that gave it a texture like there was sand mixed in needless to say this did not provide a smooth canvas for my manicure and when two coats of gel polish over it still could not completely smooth it out my only choice was to put a glitter overcoat over everything to camouflage it so unimpressed love love love very easy to apply and the topcoat is amazing week 3 and no chips on my nails i have tried many other products but this is the best highly recommend terriblequality make sure you are sober when you put it on the first it is more difficult than regular polish but it is 100 worth it very great colors and it last a lot longer base is not good top coat does cure pretty quickly but they really do not help the gel stay on longer as my gel chipped the next day was pretty annoyed at that good quality very shiny but to little of product i am glad i bought these but the top coat has been leaking a bit out of the top so it will not last as long as i would like but i still am pretty glad i bought it and the price is not bad either i love this brand these are amazing unlike some name brands this product is too soft and allows your nails to tear and peels off way too easy it is ok i trying better that keep your nail polish on more two day sad i have to do my nails very two days because of product is not good not worth the money excellent base top coat makes my nails really shiny and hard and my polish last for 2 weeks but it does seem to dent if you push your nail or something sharp into it and for that i am removing one start removal is easy too with a 180 grit file i gave it 2 stars because the base coat get hard at all so i order a different kind i hope it works better bad quality i use gel polish that does not require a base coat so i only use the top coat it dries down nice and hard and does not have a sticky finish my biggest complaint is that the top coat almost separates and does not provide an even finish does the job for the most part  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                i was not impressed with the image quality also the app that was suggested to use my phone as a remote for it did not work properly biggest pain to attach to a helmet but works well otherwise the only thing about the camera was that i had no clue it was so small we enjoy using this camera to get a canine view of our dogs activities it fits well into their harness and we get to see them running swimming and playing there are a large number of function and features so reading the instructions is a must especially to take full advantage of the power of this camera it holds up well to use we have had no problems with it in several months would definitely purchase again not a good purchase this camera works as advertised and video quality is more than i expected great features for the price the adhesive in some of the mounts could be better i wish they had special mount for ski helmets this is a 12 megapixel camera with 4k video waterproof case is good and numerous attachments for mounts are included photo quality is less than average compared to my iphone 6s and i can not get videos to play at all overall i would spend a few extra dollars and buy a better platform to capture life with i bought this as a gift for my son we have not had a chance to use it just yet the only issue i have had was inserting the sd memory card something seemed to be wrong with the slot it would not stay inserted all the way in it seemed it was engaged like it already had a card in the slot after some time i did manage to get it in correctly we did do a practice video and took a picture it has nice quality we cannot wait until the weather warms more to try it out bought this for my 9 year old son several months ago it has been great glad we bought it high quality for the reasonable price and a tough little camera it is holding up well no negatives i can think of works well with phone app glad i did not spend the extra money for gp no need this thing does it all lots of videos on youtube comparing the two see for yourself does not always stay oni use it as a dash camera the wifi system sucks on this camera and the app it requires you to use keep crashing i found another use for the camera but i would never by this camera again i love this camera works wonders for dirt bike trail riding and capturing sea life under water product shipped fast seems like a great camera so far just recently started using so not sure how to rate long term yet audio does not pick up well in the protective case but the video is great we are still learning to use it but the grandkids have fun recording things i got this for my husband for a gift the app did not seem to work well with his motorola phone sinking issues and gave up on it he has recently uodated to a new samsung galaxy 10 so hopefully will be able to get it to work wit good price but takes terrible videos it is not worth the time to even save these videos look at the videos on the feedback i do not know why people think this is a good camera do not waste your time very difficult to figure out what parts go to what and what they are used for if you give them a good review they will give you another accessory that you will have no idea how to use no instruction manual included i guess you get what you pay for i should have checked youtube before purchasing this got it today returning tomorrow so far i am impressed with this product one things for sure no matter what you plan on mounting it to there is an accessory included to do so i have only had it for a day but so far so good does not upload to your computer hard to work this little cam is really good i went to the bahamas last week and took many under water videos and photos and this camera work like a dream just remember to put in a high speed micro sd card not included i absolutely love this and i have recommended it to all of my friends i would definitely purchase this again thank you no way that this is 12mp no way also and this was the main reason why i returned it the batteries lasted less than half an hour on a full charge and for some reason the only way i could have turned on the camera was if i removed the battery from its compartment and reinsert it product works very well i use it for fishing and nature hikes taking videos hands free is a big advantage i was impressed with all of the attachment accessoriesexcellent value while the picture is great it appears that you have to set the date and time every time you change the battery i have not found anything in the manual that will save the date and time permanently which is unacceptable well i just found it 11 it says if you replace the battery date and time will reset wt disappointing did not even work for 30mins in the water and stop working do not waste your money updated reviewsupport to the win after seeing this review the manufacturer emailed me back and sent me 2 new batteries no charge and both were timed by filming a clock lol and both did about 2hrs of run time of course i ran this once on each once summer comes i will pull out the helmet cam and go riding and push the camera to the limit advice be sure to keep the camera outside of the waterpoof case if your riding in the heat it gets hot with those batteries thanks akaso for the follow uporiginal reviewi purchased this for my mtn bike rides and well it works nice but if you like having to try and time yourself on the trail and at 20 min per battery and only have 2 batteries than well go for it its a nice toy otherwise ya pay for what you get the quality of the camera is about what you would expect for 60 it works exceptionally well in brightly lit areas like the outdoors and it also has a wide variety of attachments that make it great for whatever activity you plan on documenting such as hiking water sports or skatingit is a great entry camera for people who are interested in getting involved with filmography so i bought this item last year for a xmas gift and we are now just being able to use it and the cord does not charge the battery works great for its price as well as wrist watch works with simonides cameras as well great product great battery life lots of ways to use this camera ordered this thinking it would b great to b able to video our hunting dogs we were surprise at all the features it offered must download the instructions and read carefully in order to get the best use from camera gave to grandchild loves to show what he does would not work for half my trip bought a memory card for it that was ment for the device kept saying card in validbatterys lasted about an 1hr have not had a chance to give a performance test of it the box ship in was way to small for the item and it could have lucky it did not get damaged so right now only can say packaging was not good will see later this week if camera is any good it seems like a good camera i have only used it in the pool so far i will not do scuba diving with it until junethe instructins are very lacking so it makes it much harder to figure out how to usealso i thought it had way to many extra parts that i will never use very very complicated it will take a while to figure out after opening the box and trying to figure it all out with no so hot directions and diagrams i gave up and gave it to a friends son who has more experience with the tech so many pieces and it was just not worth it for me i never even got it working so i cannot judge the camera at all so if you are into high tech camera stuff it might be great average user not so much it is not a bad unit if you are not willing to spend the money on the higher quality cameras bought it for hunting but it is hard to use in a pinch no comparison to the gopronot many features no zooming capabilities i guess you get what you pay forupdate since posting the above i was contacted by akaso and offered a partial refund which i received immediately once i agreed to it very good customer service camera shoots video really well for the price however the app that goes with it is garbage this is a good value camera we use for family events great price for an action cam it is a solid camera pictures are ok but they look better on my phone the batteries die pretty quick i bought this as a second action cam to use for a different angle the reviews i saw made it look impressive my main camera is a gopro hero 4 so the video and audio quality just does not compare if you were using 2 or 3 of these you could get by ok but this one just cannot begin to keep up it is kind of like a volkswagen and a ferrari having a raceone handy item with it that i did not think i would use in the remote control for videos i just do not see much use but for snapping a picture it does ok not what i expected did not like that it was not compatible with my laptop or my android phone i needed a mac computer or video editor to down load my videos fell off my motorcycle and broke and pieces first time out never got to use it this product never worked i took two videos and then it stopped turning on being the only camera i took on my trip to egypt i was very dissapointed takes amazing still shots at 60 fps while traveling at 55 mph do not buy this if you are mounting it to anything that goes down the road instead spend a few dollars more and get the brave 4 which is the upgrade to this model which includes image stabilization i cannot report yet on how good that feature is on the other camera having bought it to replace this one however this one creates unwatchable video at least mounted to a motorcycle the image shudder is horrendous you see some four different layers of the horizon jumbled together when playing back the video on the computer on this lower model the remote required the camera to be active for the two buttons to work they do not turn the camera on they do not stay lit as an indicator on the back the lcd is nice but to determine which mode is active you have to look closely for the white camera icon to go red when recording when taking a snapshot the screen flickers and resets to the camera non recording mode i used this flickering indicator to know if the camera was recording while looking through a tinted windshield where its mounted on the front of my bikethe upper model seems to have addressed some of these concerns for the better i will have to review it once i get out on the bike and test it there is yet another model that is even higher priced than the brave 4 that one s you tuber claimed had real 4k and not digitally processed 4k like these two lower models if that is a concern i had no complaint with the still frame on this camera at speed set to 60fps even if it is not true 4k this arrived with the plastic part that holds the camera to the handle broken it worked for the first couple of days then the charging became iffy to the point where i had to hold the cable titled for it to charge then the next day the usb port fell inward into the unit and it could no longer charge the failure of the usb port after only a couple uses indicates that the manufacturing of this product is inferior the camera was returned used it 4 times and now it does not work i hope the added warranty is better than the camera i bought this camera to help record a ski trip with my kids the biggest negative i have for it is that the camera is not waterproof i could not get any audio with the camera because it was stuck inside a waterproof case the whole time the worst part is the case got scratched on the lense so now i cannot use the case and cannot seem to find a replacement do not do it my husband and i got this for our cruise and the sd card would not go in the camera it is like a piece was blocking it from going in so we could not use it at all tried to get in contact and nothing spend the extra money for name brand of this is what off brand is like i appreciate the quality of this product just received this yesterday i have downloaded to apps in order to get videos one says it download once you go to it you can only hear it the other one let us you download it but cannot share it anywhere because it is only the sound as well you need a better app for people who only have phones to use i am going to try a couple more things but so far not really that great because of the app if someone could let me know what they use for their phone that would be great thanks positive product is cheap compare with others in the market image and video quality are okaynegative wifi features along with app connectivity are bad disconnects for no reason and is hard to manage sometime it will disconnect from the app but you could not work with it manually unless you give it a hard reset disconnect the battery if you want better quality and connection i suggest you go with a gopro this item have been open before arriving to me it box was without its brand new warranty seal it is very shame why is happening it it is lack of respect to the costumer please very poor quality overall picture sound stabilization are all not very good after reading the other reviews that were positive i do not know if i even had the sam camera used it for a few hours and tried to be positive after that i returned it and got a go pro and i am so much happier this camera came with so many amazing features and accessories i love how great the underwater camera quality is and that it comes with two rechargeable batteries instead of constantly buying new batteries it is super easy to use my 4year old can even operate it in the pool definitely recommend my wife and i really liked it for this price to be able to get a solid camera was really clutch we went on a trip to dr and used it for a variety of adventures and i am no camera guru at all cannot wait to try it for extreme uses used camera in and out of water works great the handle on camera needs to be longer to help stabilize the camera shot use this for my motorcycle it does the job for cheap if you are looking for an action cam 1 thing i would advise is to stock up on extra batteries my daily commute is approximately 20 minutes and when i arrive battery is near empty already maybe it is my settings not bad just expecting a bit more it works great sound is quiet if not connected to the ismart dv app battery life last less than 90 minutes screen turns black when you are recording so you cannot see what you are filming i would not recommend it i thought it was good at first but for longevity it is not worth it if you only plan to do 30 minutes between charges then it is right for you i am very happy with this camera it comes with two rechargeable batteries several mounts and a waterproof case for underwater footage i picked this up for an up and coming trip as my primary camera failed after about 17 years canon i realize this is not expected to perform on still photos as well as an slr but i figured it would do as well as my cheap phone it does not still photos are blurred no matter how they are taken if you use them for thumbnails they are fine but if you plan to take stills of your trips do not use this as you will be very disappointed the remote works the water proof case is more like water resistant on the low end drop it in the tub its not going to protect your camera in my testing also the accessories everyone raves about almost all of them are useless outside buying more parts they have a pamphlet that comes with the device you have to register to get the good stuff i refuse to do this because it means more spam it borders on misleading anyhow good low end cheap and second camera ok for primary action video but nothing to write home about good camera for price def worth it just wish batterys lasted longer ok here is my review i have loved the camera for since i purchased it and have taken many beautiful videos however i just discovered that there is really no way of editing it i am not sure why that is i expected it to be just as easy to edit it as a go pro but it is not so if you want to just look at the videos that you shoot without editing them it is a good camera takes great pictures but for me without the ability to edit it is basically worthless i downloaded about 6 different editing software apps on my phone and none of them will recognize the video file it would be nice if the company that makes these cameras addressed this issue price is awesome will not give me a heartattack in case i lost it while having outdoor activities camera is small and light enough to be attached to wrist camera is waterproof and operates well in water images and videos are stable and good quality for this price it served us well in a recent rafting trip to yellowstone and more ski trips in the winter the camara stop recording for not reason and when it was recording you can not watch all the videos only a few and the others video shows error my son and i started using the akaso ek7000 4k wifi sports action camera ultra hd waterproof dv camcorder 12mp 170 degree wide angle yesterday and he had an absolute blast with it picture quality was great unfortunately as we were charging it this morning the charging port pushed directly into the camera and was shaking around inside we were able to unscrew the front of the camera and remove the charging port it looks like it was only attached with two small tack welds i emailed the company through amazon but amazon responded that there is an issue with the email address the company provided i did not expect this camera to last forever but i did expect the charging port to last more than 24 hours the camera has one of the worst picture and sound quality i have seen our gopro got water in it and ruined so we wanted a replacement without spending so much money this is the same size as a gopropretty good quality video it came with 2 rechargeable batteries we also got the accessories which are a good cost and have so many options if you do not want to spend a lot of money this is a great option for you it is works great my only problem with it is that i was recording a thing for my school and it would suddenly freeze and the only way to fix it was to take out the battery apon further inspection it would freeze whenever shaken too harshly finally got to use my camera on a scuba dive but did not really use it because it leaked and is now not in my return window super disappointed this camera has ok image quality it has a short battery life when recording only about 1 hour it does not come with a memory cardrated 3 stars because of the short recording time battery life image quality for the money was good image stabilization not good good camera for the money this camera ruined my motorcycle trip to morocco i was hopeing to get some footage of my motorcycle trip this camera would not work for me it continually froze and would become unresponsive after less than 5 minutes of operation nice little action cam for the price takes good video sound is not the best really really poor camera and sound quality waste of money to be honest bought to record vacation memories and aircraft takeoffs and landings the sound quality is the worst the video quality is just ok this is a case where you see 4k and think its going to be great then you get it and its just ok it is a small camera and i like that i can take it with me wherever i go if i need it i like the battery and is easy to take pictures and video but i do not like too much the picture quality and color balance all depends how you want to use it unfortunately i have not been able to use this camera but twice the battery says charged but when i unplug from the power source it shuts off the buttons are confusing manual was no help i was really excited to get and use this camera for my horse back riding but guess i will look for something else this is a great alternative to trendy gopro cameras it has all the features the kids are looking for for sport videos and more good amount of accessories and quality seems as good as the gopro not a bad camera just not was i was expecting having a gopro this does not really compare after 3 weeks it stopped working i returned it for a full refund and got myself a gopro hero 5 it is working well and longer than this camera i would have kept it had it continued to work i actually bought 2 i am changing my original 4 stars to just 2 the quality of the videos i shot and downloaded are very poor not the quality of my work but from the camera from both cameras when i first noticed i went and shot with the other camera same thing it is very disappointing you get what you pay for video is extremely jumpy picture does not even seem to be 720p if you want to record your bike rides this camera is not a good choice it does not have any image stabilization image is not clear not 4k this camera is easy to use and takes really good clear pictures i have used this during hunts and for other random things great camera before i could use it for the third time the clip that holds the buttons in place the one for the power came off no it is useless under water or in salt air conditions not happy at all it was a week old at best a little shakey when running but overall it is a nice camera for the price great videos but the battery life is goes quickly the battery did not last very long a couple hours at most the plus side is the camera comes with two rechargeable batteries so i was able to replace it when it died video quality was good picture quality left much to be desired i could have taken better pictures on my phone sound is almost nonexistent when in the water proof case it comes with many accessories that i could not figure out and the manual was no help tons of accessories but not one selfie stick which is really what we wanted i bought this for a trip to kauai and it served its purpose if you are looking for an affordable option for a vacation i recommend buying this camera if you are looking to get more usage than one trip i would recommend investing in a better camera great color but battery only lasts about 30 minutes quality seems very solid has gone on a few kayaking trips so far and the waterproofing is up to the job video quality is really good although i will admit i have not spent any time testing its limits as far as fast action or low light conditions i will probably buy a few more i have a gen 1 gopro hero and this easily meets the same quality plus more features just check the video for yourself this is a recording of the audiovideo sync test available on youtube that i recorded just minutes ago i have emailed akaso support i will provide an update once i hear back the charging port no longer works seems the fins in the actual port bent over great value on the dollar got this for a trip to the usvi and got some great moments with it this does not include a needed micro card i purchased this item thinking it would be a bargain deal that is comparable to gopro they are incomparable and i wished i would have spent a little extra for a much better quality gopro like how portable it is yet provides great quality videos great for the price however it only takes good video and pictures in high light low light settings look terrible definitely not 1080 p video quality is very poor cannot be use for anything proper phone take a better video just bought this for my daughters birthday she will be using this on our vacation this summer i bought this camera as a good alternative to the name brand rival that is 5 times the cost figured what do i have to lose it is only 75 i was actually pleasantly suprised that the video quality above and under water is really good then i downloaded the software from the app store and was wondering why it has so many bad reviews and barely a 2 star rating after installing it i attempted to transfer some of my videos from the camera to my phone and the app would crash on any video that is longer then 1 minute in length also the downloaded videos remain with in the app and cannot be saved to your stream in conclusion the iphone app is very poor quality and if you do not mind removing the sd card to copy the video to your computer then this camera is a good buy otherwise if you want to use the app on your phone and to transfer the video footage to your phone over wifi i would not recommend this camera or this brand image quality and stabilization is bad returning the product does not work properly as expected some time it turns on some time it does not battery were fully charge this item sucks really easy set up works great i used it in my car to capture the back roads and the battery life is a lot shorter than another action camera used it once ride and returned it just because of battery life nice action cam but they could do better no stabilization at all no instructions included but did come with a good bit of attachments it is okay i bought a memory card when i video the screen blacks out after a min there were bubbles on the screen when i opened it i liked the camera and had good picture unfortunately the cover of my battery broke and now i cannot used i wish they would include in the description somewhere that this camera does not include audio only photovideo waste of money for me  \n",

the keyboard being backlit pretty pissed about that considering it the reason i chose this laptop over others i was looking at otherwise it works fine for the basic little wprd processor i use it for also not a cool design like any online description of the model this one is straight flat black incredibly plainlooking and one of my keys is at a wonky angle but it works considering the ither asus products i own this one falls short honestlyif you want to take it out of s mode go to activation and choose to change your edition to regular windows home its a free switch works goodbut the keyboard is not backlitgood buy if you do not need a backlit keyboard i love how light weight and compact it is and the numeric pad as well so far i am pretty happy and content with it i ordered this small laptop for work purposes and general office operations so far it is been well worth the money i took it out of windows s mode it struggled lagged a bit with chrome so i resorted to using the microsoft internet browser but it is been fine and since i only use it for work general office stuff it is done everything that i could have askedthus far the number dial is pretty accurate sleek design and very lightweight perfect product for the average commuter if you feel that you need the trifling advantage of the easy access numberpad go ahead and buy this one if you do not avoid this oneit is a constant annoyance think you can permanently disable the numberpad good luck with that amazing product it is small do you can easily carry it around with no extra weight for 190 bucks this is perfect i think tablets are very overrated i only like touchscreens on a phone this computer is the size of a tablet incredibly light i just wanted something to do my financial stuff email shop and casually browse the internet i do not watch movies on my computer but it plays you tube type videos just fine sound is a little weak but if i want to listen to music i can cast it to my stereo what i like best is the size and weight small and light and it seems to be built solid i charge it at night and use it off and on all day and there is plenty of juice left i could probably charge it every other night if i wanted i have only had it a couple weeks but i feel very good about my purchase screen was good but touch screen suckedthe lol mouse would disappear from screen and just pop up anywhere and would not click on items the 1st clickit takes multiple clicks to get to where i am trying to go it is perfect for my personal use and easy to navigate light weight and fits into my bag to carry with me i like the size and for the price it is worth buying small compact and convenient stay away from windows 10 s let me tell you what it is trash you cannot download anything from browser unless is from their crappy app store i could not download sketchup this is the worst part you cannot use google like what the f they only allow you to use bing who in the right mind uses that search engine no oneeee you have to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to windows 10 pro to be able to use your brand new computer like a normal person would like to do very very disappointed with this stupid windows 10s upgrade not even an upgrade please do your self a favor and buy a mac my wife bought this for email and facebook essentially i had to uninstall the windows 10s features because it kept freezing on the screen that said only approved windows 10 s apps would workthis warning came up randomly even though the only apps on the laptop were from the microsoft app storefinally i said ok no more windows 10s and dropped it in favor of plain windows 10 since that time there has been no problem and no discernible detriment to the function it is very small so be advised if this is a concern 07242021 being

resolution and refresh rates i just wanted something simple to use for files and meetings however the webcam is awful the image is poor quality and if you move at all you will be one big blur so i will need to buy a separate webcam to use the key clicks are loud as you type and although the number pad on the mouse pad is a nifty option it will come on and off when you do not intend it to overall not bad for the price but the high rating seems to be misleading not sure how much i trust amazon reviews at this point i saw no mention of the poor quality webcam and that was one thing i noticed right off the bat considering how prevalent zoom is nowadays worked great out of the box but would not turn on the next day shame as it was perfect for my needs quit working after a week it has m2 which supports nvme ssdsoldered ram works pretty fine to me i buy it for my daughter and it have all thing that she needs perhaps i goofed or something but even a live boot would not take it is not user friendly well worth the price small long battery life enough capability to support remote learning cheap chinese garbage so far the l210 slim laptop is good for working on projects and would make a great investment for a highschool or college grade laptop had to make a couple adjustments like uninstall the graphics driver and install the intel one because graphics problems with chrome as well as in chrome disable the use hardware acceleration when available setting because of graphics errors caused the other adjustment made was creating my own power plan because with the one that comes premade for it does not do the laptop much justice basic power plan was 46 hours on battery but with a well setup plan have it setup it can do 610 hours with videos and 1012 hours on everything else from browsing web to having multiple programs running some stuff you should know is the graphics is 2gb which can handle 1080 videos easy depending on your internet speed 4gb of ram and barely any is actually used unless you have alot of programs running at once the processor says 12ghz dual core but the speeds that have been running are 184ghz so far depending on what is running does not get too hot when running games or videos so will not get burns when sitting a your lap 1 thing though is that it is listed as having a backlit keyboard but it does not have one after dealing with windows updates and driver updates there is around 2025 gb left of space available so if you decide to buy one of these laptops make sure to get a micro sd card for it so you can expand the space and i recommend 120500 gig works good fast light weight outside of the mouse pad i like it a lot it is been more than a month since i got mine and about 3 weeks in the touch pad stopped working trying getting it fixed by a technician who wants an arm and a leg to fix it i am not a fan of using a mouse so disappointment is an understatement at this stage remember you get what you pay for very slow but for paying bills and very light gaming it is serviceable initially i thought i would gotten one of those rare deals something fairly good for a lower price i was being optimistic1 screen saver does not work2 when in sleep you cannot always get the computer to wake up you have to reboot3 applications lock randomly chrome excel etc initially thought it happened after the laptop had been idle for awhile but it happens randomly at any time even when in use some or all apps become lockedunresponsive and you have to closerestart them4 this is more a personal gripe the sound quality is very poor but again it is a low end computer so it really should be expected i just did not expect the sound to be this badon the plus side 1 it is fairly fast and boots quickly the picture description says backlit keyboard but it is not whomever designed the website for asus should be fired i went through a big hassle trying to find an asus laptop that actually had the backlit keyboard that was advertised on several of their models but did not have it i wound up buying an asus 14 laptop that actually had the advertised backlit keyboard from office depotoffice max i had them verify it before i bought it usps delivered this today big box with a fairly big box and padding in it with a small and light laptop in that i had it unpacked and charging in no timesince i never intended to ever use the win10 installed on it or even boot it it took a bit to figure out how to get into the computer settings so that i could boot from a usb drive that i had linux mint installer loaded ona word of caution for those that are going to install linux the current popular install isos do not have the drivers for the wifi chip the drivers will have to be installed manually bluetooth does however work and i was easily able to link this computer to my iphone and get out to the internet that waywork a round i ordered a cheap 20 tp link usb 80211n only 25ghz wifi adapter plugged it in and it just works maybe someday linux will have drivers for the built in wifi chip in this devicewhile the only cpus that intel makes that are crapper than a celeron is a atom i found this on the webthe intel celeron n4020 is one of the most budgetfriendly and powerefficient laptop processors as for gaming the intel uhd 600 graphics of the celeron n4020 is one of the weakest solutions it can be used only for the lightest gamesto sum up the above it is a very cheap and uses very little powerfor its size the keyboard and screen are ok the keys have good travel it has a matte screenthis is a small and very light computer it is snappy enough surfing the web and running linux native applications while i am not clear on this but it appears that it can be charged with a standard usbc chargeri will have to take it out in the wild to see how the battery life holds up on it running linux the battery should last as least as long or longer than it does while running win10 i bought this laptop to use for leisure travel this next year wanted something bigger and more useful than the tablet i currently have while i have just started the setup process ie loading my apps files etc it is doing exactly what i wanted it to do i have switched to windows home installed all my apps and it is currently updating windows it is showing lots of promise this was a major selling feature for me since i work nights description needs updated it is fine otherwise but the trac pad stopped working a few days after we started using it recieved yesterdaystill reading info on using micro soft i am use to google use but this lap top has much more to offer it will take time to get use to it purchased this laptop in march 2021 and it only lasted six months with light use one day i could no longer connect to the internet ran the troubleshooter and it said it could not find a network adapter tried everything suggested but still cannot connect to the internet total waste of money i am giving this tablet two stars as it is inexpensive under 200 and lightweight other than that i would give it one star i should have read the description more carefully as it is not a touchscreen model get your fingers to work on the touchpad if hard enough but the way this was designed if you are not very careful you are constantly turning on the numbering feature it is a serious stupid design you have all the number above the alpha keys grab a calculator if you need it i waited too long on return it excellent for just information support for your job 365 micro soft is useless for the price you cannot complain it works for basic usage as browsing the internet i would recommend for anyone who needs a laptop with basic functionality easy to use up in a second i love it then i realized that i could not hear a damn thing i am on a computer 12 hours a day i know how to work them i adjusted the controlsblah blah could barely hear the volume on some things particularly youtube finally looked and lo and behold the speaker are on the bottom how in the hell can speakers project when you have the danged thing in your lap my thighs completely block all sound so in order to hear certain things i have to hold it up to my face yes i have trouble shooted everything yes i know what i am doing and yes i am sending it back sound sucks and i do not want to have a little speaker attached to the top so i can hear perfect for what it has been designed for internet browsing music playing videos can play terraria arrived without windows bootingupon boot enter bios and i get no bootable device you can tell the manual has been beat up when filling in return on amazon i find support phone number but despite being advertised as open nobody answers i dislike the confusion with it is programs not one to be a refresher onafter so many yearsi feel i made a mistake with choosing this laptop is smaller but has everything you need for school and very light so easy to travel with overall good computer for price sound stopped working completely after a week it will not turn on after having it led than 30 days what i expected it is cute and quiet but the screen is made in a way that you have to look at it at a certain angle or it feels weird on your eyes and only the center circle is bright while the edges appear dark i have never hated a laptop screen so much it is almost like it has a privacy screen on it well it really was not what i was looking for it is kind of slow and i really could not get too many good apps on it and it seems much smaller than what it is size is supposed to be i wanted this laptop to do only one thing act as the control for a label printer but it could not even do that it took forever to boot and everyday tasks kept crashing it totally useless i returned it as soon as i could get it to shutdown this computer was a great purchase for my son he likes to play roblox minecraft and steam games this computer has the capability and speed to play these games and plenty of room to hold them it is not a gaming computer but is capable of playing these games without too much lag time the touchpad that moves the mouse icon does like to stop responding to touch but simply press the f6 key to toggle it back on and off and it will start working or plug in a mouse the battery lasts an extremely long amount of time the display is very clear and good quality excellent product for the price the seller lucky trading has excellent customer service and was very helpful with communication and when i needed product support highly recommended i only needed the computer for zoom whenever i touched the mic i had to hit it several times to turn on mic to speak it was a pain so i returned the computer i prefer touch screen a larger screen it took about ten minutes to download google chrome and when it did simply opening a new tab on the app took at least two minutes for it to fully load i bought this laptop to use for writing and schoolwork but the speed was just unbearable much smaller than i imagine but was ok easy to carry around fast enough for my use dislike nothing i use it for work l like that it was easy to use it is a laptop and it does laptop things if you need it to do heavy intensive things it might not do the thingsbut if you keep your expectations low you will probably not be disappointed the size and range of motion is pretty cooledit the family safety automatically being turned on is irritating the dumbest thing i have ever seen i have taken some mins to set the computer up i do not want to spend more time screen might put some people off battery is phenomenal it is silent and the audio is fine perfect for on the go  \n",
       "4  bought for school work doing good so farsleek it is alright i bought this laptop a week ago the touch pad worked at first once i upgraded windows 10 the touch pad stopped working i went to the acer site to download a new driver for this pos of course it did not work that is why i am giving this a bad review i have tried several things to fix this laptop none of them worked my son loves his laptop one of his favorite devices so far one suggestion by memory card to go along with this laptop i purchased this for my online college classes and am so glad i did awesome product this computer has totally inadequate volume the return was readily accepted by the seller but when i actually took the computer into the ups store i had to pay 21 to have it shipped with the properly printed return label never had to pay to return an amazon purchase before what a ripoff best laptop for this price 5 star i love everything about this laptop horribly horrible computer do not buy screen went out in less than a week only used it once or twice before it went to h e double hockey sticks to the trackpad has scrapes in it when i got it returned it it is been two weeks and i am being told it will take another 2 weeks for my refund to process the body is also thin plastic and not metal like some other aspire 7s including the trackpad get another gaming laptop the rog zephyrus g14 is on sale at best buy right now for almost the same price with a better gpu cpu and an all aluminum chassis basically the one thing that turned me off is that it warns you not to download the google browser because it may make it unstable this will be my last acer i expect notebooks to last around 3 years and that is when you actually use it i used this one as a spare and hardly used it at all in fact i just found it does not even have a battery that you can take out i would not recommend this product great little laptop performs well i do mostly work on it microsoft office audio editing on audacity minor video editing and some music composition with sibelius and it runs flawlessly occasionally i travel and play games on it league of legends and world of warcraft and it runs those just fine too wow on lower graphics settings only down side to this machine is there is very little memory make absolutely sure you budget for cloud storage or an external hard drive if you go with this machine not nearly enough ram slows up with just basic web browsing this is a great laptop for the price but the worst thing about it is the placement of the touchpad it is on the left hand side below the keyboard which makes no sense it should be centered or more on the rightthe screen color is also a bit bright so if you want to edit photos on here beware of that also this thing is kind of heavy this is not bad but i would not buy it again the speakers are horrible and under the computer making it hard to hear i am deaf and you have to pick up the computer to hear them the cap lock key does not a light on it let you know it is on drives me crazy no cd rom either love this laptop except why would you put the speakers on the bottom which makes the sound horrible at least make the max volume higher so you can at least hear without needing external speakers initially once i set everything up i was pretty pleased with my purchase but after a little over a month and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month the screen went black but the backlight on the keyboard was still on so i figured it just needed to be charged i left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it still lit keys but no screen so i changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more came back to it same thing i tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference i never took it out of s mode and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs basically just checked my email a few times now when i plug it in nothing lights up the adapter on the charger does not have any indicator light to show that it is working so it could be a faulty power cordi am going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers but in any case a brand new device should last longer than a monthnow my return window has closed so i am either stuck with a 350 paperweight or i will have to search online and buy a new charger and hope that works i do not spend a lot of time on the computer i purchased the computer so i could do some personal writing i like the fact that it had microsoft office installed i did not like the the restriction to only use apps provided through the microsoft store to download other apps like zoom i had to disable the microsoft security system which cannot now be reactivated on my machine but as far as general use of the computer it has been great unfortunately i have to write a bad review on this one i have babied this laptop and while it was a decent for cheap laptop i cannot believe it just died on me after 14 months i did not get a warranty because the price was more than half of the laptop costagain inexpensive laptop i expect slow etc but not death easy to set up liked the keyboard i added another 4 gb memory just a nice overall laptop it is a lot smaller screen keyboard etc than i had before though i had an acer aspire before i do not like it probably will return it and would not recomment it for older people nice laptop for the money i still do not like windows battery life is lousy my lab top has quit working it will not restart it is froze my mouse will not work it will not let me do anything for the price point its a great laptop first i added another 2gb ram for under 20 and upgraded before i start with the positive one big negative when the laptop goes to sleep mode it take 2540 sec before it wakes up it is very strange its not a traditional hard drive i did not change any settings i have to hit the power button and literally sit there for it to turn on pretty annoying other than that screen quality is phenomenal speed is more than adequate for ms office apps it can also handle streaming and 810 browsers at a time for school work anything non hardcore this is a good laptop sound quality i aways use my bluetooth headset anyway sound is bit more towards the stereo sound i am sure that can be adjusted just havnt played with itlike others have said you cannot go wrong at this price point i just hope it lasts and do not bog down or slow down with updates and what not this laptop is giving me nightmares the touchpad is super sensitive to accidentally turning off ok fine restart and it is back to normal if nothing else works forgetting the inconvenience then this morning after an update to windows 10 the touchpad is not simply off it is not in settings there are no drivers it is just effing gone so here i am using a mouse i hate because the laptop basically does not work as a laptop take into consideration when thinking about purchasing this model it is cheap yes but if you actually need to use on the go or in your lap it is a bad choice i purchased this laptop for general purposes as well as using the cricut desgin space for my cricut machine my old laptop was just running too slowly and i needed an upgrade first off the price is amazing and i am fully aware that you get what you paid for but i feel like i got more than i paid for with this i do not know much about specs and the ins and outs of computers so here are some pros and cons from a general userpros the look and design is very very sleek fairly lightweight the screen resolution amazing it seems fast so far the battery life is very good i have been working continuously for about three hours now without it plugged in and i still have 14 battery life left it does come downloaded with windows 10 s mode however there is literally a sticker directly on the box directing you to a website that explains a stupidly easy four step process to permanently get out of s mode it was the first thing i did based on other reviews and have no issues it was free to do and took 2 minutescons caps locknum lock do not have an indicator light i am already finding this very annoying but i use a usb keyboard most of the time anyway so it is fine the sound is awful if you are using this laptop for streaming games etc you will need headphones no seriously it is really bad the quality is okay but it does not get loud at alloverall with a couple of days of use i am impressed with this purchase as soon as possible if you are looking for an affordable general use laptop i bought this laptop for my wife for her job i wanted something not pricey and just something that worked i saw the high amount of five star reviews and i read through some of the lower starred reviews and thought that will not happen to me bsfirst of all the computer got shipped quickly and got here undamaged but that is the only good i can say about it the backlight for the keyboard goes off quickly and you have to press a key to turn it back on instead of moving the mouse and you cannot change it as you may have read in other reviews the computer comes with windows 10 s mode installed but my product key is not genuine it says that the digital license is not valid because of this it will not activate windows which means i cannot take it out of s mode if the computer is in s mode then you cannot download any apps or programs that you would normally use like mozilla or vlc or even chrome and furthermore you cannot access the command prompt which means you cannot even activate the windows even if you wanted toi have contacted microsoft who told me that they could not do anything and to contact acer i contacted acer and they told me to try one single thing which i already did and confirmed that it does not work then told me i had to send in the laptop to the techs which would take another two weeks just to get it backsooooooooooooooooo long story short it is a never ending loop of disappointment anger and resentment and a complete waste of time and money do not buy save yourself the trouble this laptop was overpriced screen quality is decenttouch screen not reallythis is not a gaming laptopturn off the wifi so it does not interfere with your cell phones connectivity or other tabletcomputer overall a great laptop for the price i added 8g of ram really easily it is fast and cheap however some technical issues s mode is horrible got rid of it immediately my powerpoint screen recording function would not work called microsoft and they were very helpful they rolled back my display driver to microsoft basic and worked perfectly but then the computer would not recognize my second screen called acer and they told me they did not have another display driver to download and referred me to a third party answers by that wanted to charge me 99 to fix the issue for some reason the internet was really slow played with two different routers i had it was still slow even with a triband router and no other devices connected to the internet then i connected to the guest wifi i had set up and it worked perfectly i suspect this may be a driversoftware issuefor the price it is hard to beat this but get ready for some compatibility issues and no support from acer this pc was good but the camera did not work i opened case they could not fis it poor product support dod not buy this pc do not buy this pc very poor support from amazon and acer product would not work out of the box and after an hour with tech support made the decision to return i love everything about this laptop especially the built in alexa it is so sleek and stylish my daughter told me it looked just like her mac laptop best buy anywhere for a laptop at a reasonable price with all the features arrived late speaker volume is lowgreat lt for price will not find anywhere else stopped working after 4 months of light use the first time i attempted to use my webcam for a important zoom interview it would not work after acer did hours of trouble shooting with no resolve they told me i had no other choice but to reset my laptop to factory settings which meant i lost almost everything i had on my laptop when it was determined that losing all of my content was for nothing they finally checked the device manager and discovered that no webcam drivers had been installed they then told me that i would have to pay to send the laptop back to them for repairs i refused to pay out anything more needless to say i will never purchase from acer again hard drive crashed after 7 months and it was going to cost more than the computer to fix product arrived on time and was as advertised no surprises nothing special about this recent buy no issues thus far appreciate the graphics card vs the newer model with the integrated card helps with some lighter games and other graphicsintensive apps horrible product bought it in march and it keeps disconnecting from the internet sound is absolutely horrible now i have a laptop that is absolutely useless it will not stay connected to wifi i constantly have to reconnect to wifi even after just a few minutes of inactivity everything is good for the price but the volume is to low l had to return and get an apple instead even though it is double the price this is a nice laptop for the price no issues so far at all i did need to take it out of s mode in order to install zoom which is basically mandatory these days the batter life is trash and heats up fast i bought this entry level acer as an extra to have around and was not expecting much for the price everything about this computer is very good except for the low volume of the sound i am not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume i was not expecting bose quality but i was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100 it is not here is what i did checked drivers opened the realtek to confirm all were set at 100 upon researching other reviews i noticed similar low volume issues it appears that this is where acer skimped i have an entry level toshiba that has horrible quality sound but it is loud i need to blutooth an external speaker just so i do not have to bring my ears to win 8 just to hear of course it does not help that acer put the speakers on the bottom yes the bottom of the unit it is a shame that acer did so much right for the price only to mess up on a incredibly low volume would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100 the answer to my rhetorical question is no but they did anywayoverall i would have given the unit 4 stars maybe even 5 but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3 at best unfortunatelymy takeaway is that i will not buy another acer without hearing the sound first built in camera and mic not working computer works well still trying to learn the operating system as it is different from the last computer worked fine for 13 months of occasional use and then out of nowhere the motherboard failedjust outside of the mfr warranty window piece of junk i absolutely love this laptop key board lights went out and i am a senior citizen with eye problems who runs a help line to get services for families trying to get moms into recovery and am limited in times i can help to day times when i can see the keys microsoft edge is the worst browser first off secondly this laptop did an automatic update and deleted several of my saved documents which are unrecoverable hours of work are lost it also blanked out 4x during a timed midterm exam last weeki have had this laptop for just 6 months sad to say i will not purchase acer again i purchased this product based on many reviews after waiting 30 minutes to set up this thing i called acer support this thing would not set up windows there is a 22 digit serial number that has to be provided fast and you have to use a telescope since the type is very small and is located no where near where the tech said it was am going on 3 hours now to fully set thing up and am about ready to send it back pure frustration this thing has all kinds of features but one important feature it lacks is the ability to set it up without having to take 3 hours of your life to do so recommend you buy something else overall its an ok computer but the speakers seems damaged its extremely low and there is a feedback computer works great just as advertised good value would buy again works exactly how i expected it to and does everything i need it to do a very good laptop for the price given i got this for gaming by day 3 the touch pad stopped working i troubleshooted it for days nothing worked it only works with a mouse i was very disappointed i returned this item and will buy a different brand really sucks because i liked it for gaming i have been very satisfied with this purchase so far i have only had it set up for less than a week so i cannot really state how well the battery is going to bebut so far it is great i have only had one small problem with setting up the email but i am just going on my web browser and accessing it from there not sure what the problem is probably something on my nonthechie side of the screen it is a great value for the money and i have absolutely no complaints the best feature i have found so far is the back lit keyboardi had no idea how wonderful this would beit is great i used to have to squint or turn on a light but not anymore it is really an amazing little labptop and the screen is crystal clear the speed is very fast and so far i am loving this laptop way more than the last 2 hewlett packards that i have had to replace due to faulty battery setting i love this computer works like a charm keyboard start to having pressing issue after a while specially the one you use most otherwise it is a great computer i bought this computer for a new full time remote position the computer is great for very basic needs only a couple tabs open and browsing the internet i needed to have 10 tabs open and be able to toggle back and forth very quickly for my role and this computer could unfortunately not keep up if you need something faster i would get the same computer but with an i5 processor for 200 more well worth the difference have had the new computer for a week and it runs remarkable faster and can keep up with what i need donealso i plugged in a bluetooth mouse to this computer and once i unplugged it i could not get the touch pad to work anymore so it is a good thing i am returning it as it also had this alternative issue backlit keyboard is nice but i hate to have to pay for word processing i hate this gortana which pops up all the time it is a cheaper computer that does its jobbut the mouse pad thing does not work anymore so i have to use a external mouse this has the potential to be a good computer but acer ships this in s mode windows 10 home cannot be activated running slui 4 will open the installation id but microsoft cannot activate that number the agent said i needed to call acer i called the tollfree number included with the computer and was told by that agent to call microsoft whodathunk or send it to acer to be repaired it was out of the box for ten minutes and they wanted it to be repaired thanks to amazon it is being returned run away i purchased this computer for my small business job within two weeks of use the down key came off amazons response is to glue the key down which is absurd you cannot just glue a key down which i explained but they said that is all that they could do they would not replace the computer i purchased this laptop for school social media youtube browsing i absolutley love it no complaints so far it is really good i actually got it two days earlier than they said they were going to send it to me which that is great not lasting more then 1hr and lagging when you unplug the cable still working on this hope to up my rating if we can get things working first experience with the system was very positive issue is that on day two i saw a message in the lower right corner of the screen go to settings to activate windows settings says we cannot activate windows on this device because you do not have a valid digital license or product key if you think you have a valid license or key select troubleshoot below troubleshooter says something interrupted our troubleshooting called acer support and was told they would mail me windows installation usb memory stick waited a little over one week and asked for status update was told that usb install media was not available and i should contact microsoft for activation entered last four digits from activation error message and was told i would need a new product key contacted acer support again and was told we would need to return the computer to the factory for fix which could take 1520 business days plus shipping time briefly considered returning to amazon be decided to try the acer service option will be awhile before we get it back the physical device is very nice lighted keyboard good except no indicators for caps lock nor num lock that is unfortunate what acer saved 2 to not include two little leds bluetooth nonoperating out of the box so will need to troubleshoot touchpad stopped functioning after a few weeks another thing to troubleshoot hope that is all the bad stuff that happens to this new machine we got this as a grad gift for our grandson great price great laptop fast delivery flimsy returned it finally unboxed this laptop have not used much but the charger that came with it is not original making me think it is a refurbished laptop advertised as new or sent a used one will update this review when i have used it a bitif i do not return it it very light weight but not very fast screen quality it is good purchased this for a high school kid does what it needs to do the base model is ok i like that you can upgrade this in the future they included the bracket for a secondary drive i will be buying more of these for clients works well for school wish i had read i to description more no sd card or disc reader so cost was not as well as i thought after buying external readers windows does not run as smoothly on the acer as it did on my dell my games do not work as well have to refresh page often when searching on internet not happy with this product cannot complain about an acer product for the price and quality i live everything about it except the battery lifei constantly has to recharge it to appoint i just kept it plugged most of the time a good performance to summarize you get what you pay for i was not expecting to run into so many problems right when i took this out of the box1 immediately i heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when i pulled it out of its packaging2 the sound is so bad it is like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store the speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality3 loud fan when it gets a little warm when using4 scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs i had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos i noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs5 customer service from both acer and amazon makes it difficult to fix yourmy issues i contacted customer service the same day after i received this laptop and also the day after after telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed6 possible restocking fee wanting to return this item even though i barely used it the first 2 days customer service told me that i cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it before they can tell me whether or not i will be charged a restocking fee if you do not like being surprised by restocking fees do not buy this laptop so you will not have to return7 i was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem basically to spend more money just so i can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file8 screen quality is definitely not good i would give it a 610 the color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor the difference is super noticeable9 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me you would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you are basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usablei know this has good reviews but do not be fooled by it i was swayed when i was going through the reviews but after i got my product i was highly disappointed i wish i had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop this one is not worth the regular price i would say with the issues and quality of this laptop the price should be around 250 works fine sound could be louder i tried 3 of them they perform differently from each other and they appeared to have different hardware suppliers internal parts made by random manufacturers for example m2 port is only pcie x2 speed and advertised internal sata3 port performs about 300mb write and 500mb read on a drive rated 530mb write 550mb readover it looks as if it was put together in a hurry debris around plastic body can easily can cut hands skin etc this laptop is great and i had it for months but when i first got it i had to pay another 100 dollars to take s mode off of it the computer itself is great for basic use checking email browsing the internet writing papers etc i bought it because i have a macbook and most department of defense websites are not compatible with mac os my biggest complaint is that 1 month into owning it the charging cable does not seem to work anymore and i am terrified for the day that the battery dies and i have no way of charging it after that not good as described not hapoy with battery performance it is a great laptop sometimes it can act a bit uppity but just restart it if you just installed some apps also it comes on s mode which you can change to regular windows 10 for free go in settings application switch to windows 10 mode good laptop but ended returning found one better cheap laptop you get what you pay for no hard drive no cd player mouse board difficult to control the product key on the laptop was bad and so i could not activate it acer customer support was horrible told me if i had bought it directly from them they could have given me a new product key but since i bought it from amazon i am pretty much on my own last time i buy this brand machine is a really great budget machine i got it for my wife for school but more than just a throw away machine in the standard form it was nothing great adding more ram woke it up a lot better overall performancethe backlit keyboard is huge plus for working at night screen resolution and clarity is great as well i had to return my laptop after the mouse cursor had mysteriously quit working after 3 days of use while i am used toto apple products i tried troubleshooting my windows laptop even tried restarting in safe mode to troubleshoot without resolve i even performed windows recovery still no resolve confused i thought that is okay i am within the allotted time to return my laptop so i requested a return and opted for a new replacement vs refund i was careful to ensure i remained in compliance with the return policy as set out by amazon and followed the instructions stepbystep i downloaded the ra and ups label provided and used it to return my laptop as instructed the following day i checked the amazon website for status of my return only to discover that all information about my return mysteriously disappeared i did not think much of it as more than a temporary technical error as it was admittedly nearing the deadline for return having carefully followed instructions per amazons return policy and with my proof of shipment receipt from ups i was confident it would work itself out nope evidently not more than two weeks later no replacement no refund no response no communication and four to five text messages later to the seller via amazon website along w submission of my proof of shipment receipt and tracking still no record of initiation or tracking of my return the history of my messages to amazon seller and my return request are also poof gonewhat the no phone numbers just the runaroundapparently i am now out 500 and a laptop fabulousknow the risk this laptop is 14 i am soooo angry this laptop is great its affordable and have a bunch of cool features the only issue is that it is extremely low you definitely need a headset or speakers i have to lift the device to my ears to hear if i do not have any of these available i have had it for a year and so far so good i love it easy to work with screen is small whole computer is really a tiny bit larger than a notebook but the processor is fast and all i thought i was upgrading but i have to wear glasses when using this thing to see the letters i have ordered four acer laptops from amazon in the last two years and love each and every one of them i thought it would be nice buy a fifth acer laptop after reading all the positive reviews on this one they were wrong and very misleading i should have paid attention to the negative reviews they were accurate this acer laptop was the worst sound system was terrible you can barely hear it even if you turn it up to the max the mouse pad and keys were unresponsive cannot adjust the settings etc i used it for a total of thirty minutes 30 minutes after i charged it and i put it right back in the packaging i could not get it out of my house fast enough within an hour i called amazon for return authorization to pick up the laptop the following day i got my full refund amazons excellent customer service saved the day greatly disappointed by this acer laptop buyer beware consover heatsspeakers are horrible can barely hear videos had to install an additional app to make sound loudercomputer lags a bit should not lag for the price of it not recommend for the priceprosgood quality when watching videos etc i like everything about this computer except the volumeyou can barely hear anything on it dislike the teeny hddlike i can throw an external drive on it and am gtg after taking it out of s modenear perfect for my needs and decent price not touchscreen as was advertised in the question and answer section the graphics are so so worse than my last acer overall 4 stars good computer i am using it to create elearningwhen i tried to remove the computer from windows s mode i realized that the computer did not come with a product key what this means is in order to remove s mode you have to buy windows home or pro and use the product key to remove s mode i wish they would have just told me that i contacted the company via amazon chat they said i needed to contact the manufacturer they gave me a phone number there is a button on amazon to contact the manufacturer as well no successi ended up just buying the downloadable windows home version and used the product key to remove s mode i also purchased the microsoft software for powerpoint word excel etcthat is a lot of drama just to be able to download things to my computer just know that you are buying a bare bones computer when you purchase was a great computer until i had used it twice for zoom and now the speakers no longer work if i figure out why i will update when i first received this laptop everything seemed great i was very excited to set it up with my personal information and get going i very quickly realized however that this computer was extremely slow for my tastes even with no background programs simple tasks like opening file explorer or a web browser took far too much time in my opinion a brand new computer should be opening programs almost instantly not leaving me waiting a few seconds or more this is ultimately preference but i am sure there are many more laptops out there for a similar price point that would run much faster returned this after only a day or so of having it and ended up with another laptop from the early 2010s and it runs much better than this one i had this laptop for about 2 months now and i am loving it so far it is lightweight sleek and the backlit keys are great for me in my dark room it boots up in seconds ready to go when you turn it on i mostly use this for watching videos and streams and excels it that the only negative that i can think of is the placement of the speakers the speakers are placed on the bottom and really muffle the sound so my volume is always at max other than that the laptop is a great budget buy displeased some black looks more like green dotted lines are running down the middle of my screen looks like some kind of defect the laptop was purchased at the start of september and did not see usage until about the 25th of september which means in about two months this situation happened was satisfied with my purchase before this occurrence i am not sure if it has touch screen poor quality cheap just like the price laptop is unlikely to last you long charging port was junkon the positive side it is very light and smallif you choose to purchase this laptop best of luck to you the battery died after a week and the screen started blinking i needed to connect an external monitor to work bad bad bad i was told i was going to get a new battery sent to me because every since i have the laptop it will only turn on if it is plugged in to the wall and i never received a new one very cheesy one keep freezing not able open files or photos not going waste my time to fight that i love this laptop the screen is a great size it is light weight not heavy and very sleek good laptop i do not do anything out of the ordinary does what a laptop is made to do i stayed with acer because my previous laptop was acer if it did not lose the w key function i would still be using it but would buy a new battery because unless it is plugged in it randomly shuts down bad battery so the new laptop had a new surprise the sound volume is very poor now lugging a wifi speaker along wherever the laptop goes i have to not recommend for this very reason absolute garbage i really do not write reviews but when i do i usually make them for the people this laptop is good when it works but i only used this about 10 times and now it does not charge or turn on pretty much got robbed i am really disappointed i was really hyped about this product but no durability whatsoever no scratch or anything looks brand new and it is a lemon buyers beware acer aspire 5 slim laptop 156 inches full hd computer stop working this month july 2021 i purchase this item in october 2020 as a christmas gift for my grandson unfortunately the computer has stop working and the battery will not charge please contact me in reference to the warranty information i would not purchase another computer through amazon no customer service support when needed bought this for my brother laid up with back surgeryeasy to work great graphics and definitely user friendly all ok so far cute unitbut does not work after two hours black screen deadmay i have a replacement unit i love this computer but the mouse pad does not work had to buy a wireless mouse to even use it but otherwise great product good quality use it to work from home and meetings and classed i faced several issues with this pc in spite on light usage first google meet does not work on all browsers and suddenly mutes the conversation we spent ages trying to solve this problem until we discovered that it works only on microsoft edgesound quality is not clear and lowfinally the battery stopped charging and the laptop does not work except when it is plugged in power all of this happened after less than 8 months of usagea total waste of money the product arrived with a bad wireless card i returned the item and the refund was applied to a amazon gift card instead of my credit card i am not happy i have had this computer for a year and for some reason the computer will not work unless it is plugged in i originally got it for college but the pandemic caused me to stay and do school at home i have not spilled anything or dropped the computer so i do not know what the problem is nice pc but the backlighting went out after 3 weeks and acer could not help me having a laptop without being able to see the keys is not good bought one year ago already falling apart lacks durability good for a few months then you will need a new one the input to the power cord is broken and now the laptop will not charge the lever that opens and closes the laptop pulled apart stay away terrible quality i baught this laptop and after just a month and a half the mouse pad will not work scam all else ok i regret buying this laptop and spending all the extra money in shippingi am having two major troubles with this laptop1 the laptop slows down and lags badly once unplugged from power it runs fast and fine when plugged it is so bad i have gone to control panel and under power settings created a different profile for high performance and gone to advanced power settings and set everything to high performance and still the issue persistsi upgraded the ram to 16gb same issue i have done countless troubleshooting as seen on different websites my windows is updated i have switched off most background and startup apps and it is still same i just do not understand why i cannot have the freedom to use my laptop at high performance when unplugged this is crazy i am suspecting amd and acer to be behind this this issue sometimes does not happen but most times it does2 second issue is that when connected to hotspot this device will from time to time shut off internet connection for not obvious reasonso i could be in the middle of an important zoom meeting and off she goesdo not buy this if you want peace of mind the back cover also is inferior plastic considering i had a toshiba laptop for over 10 years with no problems i expected better of this but two months into it the touch pad and cursor died fortunately i still had the wireless mouse and keyboard so the laptop is still functionali do not have the time or patience to fool around with a return when i buy a product i expect it to work we will see how long it lasts track pad broke within 1 month of use amazon was no help extremely happy with this i have a laptop i can take on the go for long business trips even upgraded the ram to make it even better glad i found this  "

       "      <td>I’ll admit I was very skeptical from reviews but I decided to purchase anyways…. and so far so good! Battery life is about 7 hours of constant use (games, videos, etc). Sounds is good. I had no problems connecting to internet. The border of the phone did appear to have some scratches but not too many., The phone I received has a loose charging port that should have been replaced. It was at 27% just now and I plugged it in and opened an app. Now it just gave me the under 20% notification so it’s obviously struggling to keep the cord in place., No working well can't download any apps horrible phone My old Android works better than this junk. Please refund money. Diana Manuele, It’s for personal and the battery life issues is crazy it’s only take 2 hours, Worked slow, barely charged., Battery life is not good at all. Only last an hour., The worse I never bought. Battery is dead and I sent it in Africa, so no way to return it. Just lost my money. I could give 0 star, I’m very picky with my phone cases which means I keep buying them until I find one that’s jut right. This phone case has everything I’m looking for. It’s not to bulky and has a slim fit. It’s enclosed and has a built in screen protector. The front plastic trim doesn’t cover top and bottom front of the Like some cases making the screen “appear” smaller.The rubber is stiff and durable and not like those cheap ones the stretch out over time.One reviewer stated they had to keep taking it apart to get the moister out. Well this is NOT a waterproof case and if it was it would be heavier and bulkier. I’m wondering how that much moister is getting in ther in the 1st place. Are you bathing with it? Tip: instead of drenching the phone with cleaning solution then wiping it up, try spraying the cleaning solution on the rag itself (just enough to coat it) then use that to clean the screen.Another reviewer stated the back falls off. If you don’t snap it in correctly this will happen. Solution: go to an arts and crafts store or fabric store and ask for some double sided hem tape. It’s very thin and extremely strong. It will keep that back on if it’s a defect., Phone broke a little after a month. Was only given a small % back on return and was never told why after multiple emails. Do not buy!!!!, Phone appeared to be flawless when it arrived. It stopped recognizing any sim card after 3 months. even though it was a few days out of warranty when it died the seller still took it back for a full refund., Too small in size, The phone looks great. However, the battery life was 70% instead of the promised 80%. This means that the battery dies very quickly, even when fully charged. We attempted to contact the seller but received no response. We would have settled for an exchange, but again, no response. Looks like we have to buy a battery, add another $50 to the price to get a fully refurbished phone. Very disappointed., Hey- it’s an iPhone. I did have to buy ear buds for this unit as none came with it.The phone is OK, but the battery is horrible., GSM does not work. This version of IPhone cannot be repaired. I stop being able to update, because it does not connect to the local network. It is WITHOUT SERVICE ... that is, now it helps me to connect only by wifi and to listen to music ... Battery drains from 100 to 0 in 2 hours of use  The battery is at 50%? I mean, impossible to use it. Lousy purchase They should withdraw it from circulation to these iPhone 7, Phone came in on 86 battery life and touch screen doesn’t like to work, wouldn’t recommend this phone., phone works great, but battery needs replacement, per the iPhone settings screen, just over 3 months after purchase. Does not hold charge for long even with all settings optimized, not using GPS in background etc. Otherwise price was reasonable., The phone battery was supposed to be at 80% or better but this battery only 77% and Apple saying need to replace battery now. It's too bad vendors don't install new batteries and increase the price because changing these batteries is not fun as you can have screen damage and broken wires. Aside from that very happy with phone and fast delivery., Good condition, but instantly overheats when charge. Not sure if that’s normal but the body of it great condition, This IPhone 7 gets really hot as soon as you charge it . Also it charges slow ,, The phone is unlocked no scratches , no flaws . Came right on clear. Packaged for fragile item very well. My daughter loves her new phone., It is hard to buy from a third party and it not working is frustrating., My review is half bad and half good. It came in almost a week, which I was crazy waiting for it. I was so happy when it got here! I checked the battery capacity and it only charges to 62, which was so disappointing. It charges really fast, but loses a lot of percent quick. Other than that everything was good. It came with a charger and charger block., I ordered from Trademore to get a refurbished iPhone 7, and it arrived fully ready to go out of the box with the latest iOS version installed. All I needed to do was add in my SIM chip and sign on with my Apple ID, and iCloud Backup restore did the rest. The unit I received works like new and was actually flat (as opposed to some other refurbs I've had); it had some scratching on the glass, but not over the actual display area. Trademore and Amazon refurbs may seemed more expensive than refurbs from elsewhere, but it's worth it for a great unit with no hassles or technical gotchas., It took a while for this to become an issue. At first I was restarting the phone which I thought was fixing the problem but the proximity sensor does not function properly. As a result, when I attempt to talk on a call, the screen remains lit and the side of my face continually hits the buttons, resulting in frustration for both me and the caller. It's impossible to hold a voice call at this point. Unfortunately, by the time I realized what the problem is, the phone isn't eligible for a refund., Easy to use, I got my iphone 7 opened it was fine owner didnt factor reset it i turned it on an it was on home screen.Works well i like it!! 8/10 😃, batter health was at 70 not the promised 80., Bad phones you are not honest, I bought this for a July gift.  It stopped working 8 months later.  It would no longer receive a cellular signal.  It took about a week to troubleshoot with the mobile carrier before they said it must be your phone.  I took it to a phone repair shop and they said the motherboard crashed. 😩, So I got this phone, when it originally came, it had more damage than what was listed so I returned it. The next one that came in had little to no damage so I was excited. However, after the 30 day return window (of course) the phone has been having all sorts of problems. I have audio issues with my phone on speaker, the keyboard gets stuck constantly, and the battery life is pretty much non-existent. Incredibly pissed I bought this for 230$ and now can only get 60$ if I sell it back. Just a warning, but if you buy your phone from here you are gambling with your money honestly. So just do a payment plan through your provider or get it from apple and spare yourself the frustration, Died every 20 minutes and constantly shut off and if it was colder than 50 degrees it would not turn on., I’m disappointed with this phone’s battery life. I have to make sure I keep a charger with me everywhere I go. This is my first experience with an iPhone so maybe that is how they are, I don’t know., This was in good condition and battery life good., Seller guarantees 80% battery. Received phone with battery capacity of only 75%. Seller never replied to follow up messages and only offered a $20 credit and never replied when alternatives were requested., Bought this refurbished iPhone for our daughter.  We like the parental controls that Apple offers.  We aren't going to buy her a new expensive phone so it is nice to get a used one from Amazon., Overall good product! The cameras kind of glitches at times but it overall works. The battery dies very quickly, but it works perfectly fine even without a sim card. Very good product!, I just got this  for my middle school son in time for school to start. It needed charging upon arrival, but the charging cord/plug that came with it did not work. Luckily this  is a replacement phone, and we have other chargers in the house and so were able to get it charged.It's working so far. I can't comment on battery life yet because it's too soon. The phone appeared to be in excellent condition., Overall satisfied with iPhone 7 transaction: the phone arrived in pristine physical condition--I could not find a scratch on it.The battery however had 78% capacity, not the 80% advertised. Not sure it would have made a difference as this phone was for my 12 year old son and in the end I decided to replace the battery (which granted is not for everyone as it's not a 5-minute process - more like an hour and 44 minutes process).Was able to successfully change the battery and all is well. So, net-net was able to get a like-new iPhone 7 for under $200.Recommend this vendor but do know if you are not comfortable swapping in a new battery you'll be charging your phone 2-3 times a day as normal phone usage will deplete the battery quickly., I like everything I don’t dislike nothing, Fine, I like is because it was a easy set up and everything was good on it, i have to go to apple because i got this phone for verizon and it wont let me make calls or texts sooooo basically dont buy it, I was pleasantly surprised after reading a few not-so-good reviews ... but the iphone 7 (Verizon) that I received looked like it was brand new.  It was packaged very nicely in a custom box with a new charging cable and AC converter.  Not a single scratch on it, \"battery health\" was rated at 84% and everything worked perfectly.  Frankly, I can't imagine why someone actually traded this in for a new phone????  But I'm glad they did.  My daughter (currently my Tech Support person) was sweet enough to get me a very nice \"Youmaker\" protector for it ... she knows I'm a bit clumsy.  I've only had this phone for a few weeks but so far so good.  I even use it for visual control (FPV) on a few of my quads/drones ... it is remarkable how well the battery holds up for that video on 10-15 minute flights ... much better than my old iphone.  Very glad I bought this., Runs slow , colabirtation is off and screen glitches, Battery life is insufficient and less than expected., Phone came fast and everything is good but the battery only holds a charge for about an hour when it’s not charging pretty annoyed about this., Bad battery life junk charger, just buy new instead of having to do it anyways, Home button non functional., Wasn't bad came in good condition., If I can fit everything I didn’t like about this phone into this box I would detail it.But whoever replaced the screen did a horrible jobWon’t register any SIM cards to any carrierIt looks like I bought it from wish.com, There’s a black line when trying to take pictures, takes horrible pictures, The phone is used and it doesn’t earphones, Everything was great. Like brand new!, Like many, read a lot of bad reviews... Was worried that there would be major issues upon getting the phone. HOWEVER, my phone showed up next day, SUPER FAST. Opened up the packaging and the iphone 7 looked very very good. Couple very tiny scuffs, but was expecting such as it is a USED phone would give it a 9/10 and i'm picky. Called my phone provider and they were able to switch it to my number no problem. I have sprint, which has merged with t mobile. I got the FULLY UNLOCKED phone, for anyone wondering. After running the phone through all its tests, everything is in proper working order. Battery life is at 84% which is fine by me. Higher than the stated number of 80% anyways. Never really payed attention to that stuff on the other phones i have had. All i can say is that the phone is doing everything it should and I am very happy with it. If there is one concern, the phone may be running a hair warm, but nothing to seem worried about momentarily. I will update this post at any point in the next 6 months if need be, but so far so good. COMPANY I WENT WITH: TECH EXCHANGEE NY, screen had a small crack and a chip  and the back has some marks on it and the home button is difficult to make contact. however the phone does work., Cord does not work!, This device only worked for 6 months and it started decaying. I send it to apple and they stated that it will need a new motherboard., This was for personal use the phone has been nothing but trouble since the day we got it. Will not make calls or will make calls on its own we don’t even when we’re not even trying. Need to know if there is insurance on this purchase Or is there any kind of warranty on this purchase, Item came without a charger, I have been using my phone for about a month, from what I have been able to assess so far the phone has been working properly, the battery holds fairly well, unless playing a game on the phone it drains the battery pretty quickly. The Siri function, the finger print unlock, and camera are pretty amazing, and they are some of the many things that I did not have on my iPhone 4...so this is a wonderful upgrade for me!, Very average product! Must have been used for couple of years before reselling it. Battery life was at 80% when arrived. Good purchase if one wants to buy iPhone at cheap price, Phone works great i have to say no problems so far 5/5, Have this phone just over six months it glitches, turns off all the time, battery drains fast, phone won't shut off even when the battery is at 98%.  The amount of money I spent on it I should have gotten more than 6 months use, wouldn't recommend., The phone  barley work can’t call nobody can’t text nobody, Why it dies so fast ?, It’s ok, It’s a good phone over all but often freezes or hangs up calls on its own. Dies very fast! Annoying., The stop working in 2 weeks, Extremely scratched and banged up. Shouldn't have passed quality control. Unless the standards are that low, Perfect condition, The battery on my other phone was only lasting me from 7 am - 1 pm so I figured I would get a new phone - The new phone is lasting from 7 am - 11am and says the battery is 100% healthy...., Worst purchase ever don't waste time on this item does not even turn on turns mad hot 1st day on arrival does not turn on 2nd day return hopefully all turn out good with money back update later on, Phone has no signal, Antenna broke internally on phone within 4 months just outside the 3 month return window.  Worked great until then., i liked it except for the fact that the back had some dints in it and u can’t turn it on silent mood, Look good, Speaker are not working, Arrived a day early which is usually nice, but I planned my schedule around it arriving on the estimated delivery date. It had obvious wear on the back and there was a small blotch on the screen that must've been dead pixels or something because it was pure white regardless of what was on the screen. I didn't like it in this condition, so I returned it and they said they would deduct return shipping cost from my refund but they ended up not doing that., The phone I received did not have a working microphone. Couldn’t record or make calls. The company issued me a full refund. They have great customer service but sold a faulty device so I gave a neutral rating., Honestly I was so nervous to buy a phone from Amazon for the 7 year old stepson ... but reviews can be very deceiving .. phone worked GREAT !! Now if I can only get this 7 year old to come back to earth and stay off the phone lol needles to say he loves it ..., The phone doesn’t work. I can hear a person I call, but they can’t hear me., I loved this phone for about a half a year and loved it! However, I got a message saying my SIM card could not be read. Turns out that this is a known iPhone mistake when iPhones are built. When I brought it to the Apple store they said that because it was originally made in Japan they could not fix it or send me a new one. I am now out for a new phone. However it worked very well when it did, I just wouldn’t risk it., My battery dies way too soon. The package also arrived much later than expected and also had a decent scratch in the screen deep enough to affect the overall appearance. The camera works just as expected but it definitely was not the “new” look you can definitely see the precious wear and tear on the iphone., No work for Verizon, Great phone thank you, i was confused by the packet  i received with item, it said iphone 5s - i was ready to return(im a new iphone user) i was kinda disappointed with charger not working - had to buy additional one to use phone - overall its a great item -, The phone was very nice looking phone, but I had to return the  phone due to it was not compatible with my sprint network service., The phone constantly restarts itself. The battery lasts all of 10 minutes. I do not recommend buying a phone from this company.. they’re junk., I've only had this Iphone 7 a few days. The reason I bought it is because my previous Iphone wouldn't hold a charge for more than a few hours. So far this Iphone will hold a charge for 2 days with moderate use. I'm happy with it so far. The charger that came with it did not work but I still have my previous Iphone charger that did work. Other than that I am happy with it. It didn't have any scratches or anything and looks brand new., This review is for the seller Hybrid IT. First of all, I wasn’t expecting it to come as fast as it did. I ordered my phone Friday at 3 AM and received it Saturday by 12 PM, that’s kind of insane since they are in NY and i’m in FL. There are a few small scuffs on the bottom of the device near the speaker but otherwise it’s pretty close to perfect cosmetically. The screen has no scratches at all, i can’t tell if it’s the original but if it was replaced they did a hell of a job. The max battery capacity is 100%. it came with a charger but no headphones or headphone adapter so you will need to buy one. i haven’t experienced any issues so far but it’s only been a day so i will make sure to come back and give an update.Also if you have Metro by TMobile and you’re having trouble getting service after inserting your SIM, you have to register the phone with them before it will work, not sure about other carriers. for a second i thought i received a locked/stolen phone but i wanted to make sure. don’t give up unless the carrier actually tells you it won’t work. you can try calling the customer service number and doing it with the automated system or a representative but if you don’t have access to your old phone you need to go into the store. It took 5 minutes and only costs $15-20 depending on where you live.Overall i’m extremely pleased, it was a risk but i’m happy i seem to have gotten a good device. Thankful for all the reviews recommending to buy from this seller., The maximum capacity of the battery was on 74% when I received the phone. I can only use the phone for a few hours before the battery is completely dead. Other than them sending it with a bad battery the phone works great., DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!! I got this in today after looking for a good phone for my son for about 2 months the home button didn't work and you can't use Verizon it is not Amazon renewed its a scam, Phone is ok, no marks or scratches, but came with outdated ios that needed to be updated prior to transferring data from old phone.  Battery life isn't great., There are times when a phone is set to support another carrier, and even after a full factory reset, any carrier update will kill your mobile network.  Happened to me.  Sprint/T-mobile reset it and tried multiple times, and every time we got it to work, it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a day.That means no calls, no text, no internet if you're outside of wifi.Be warned and keep your old phone handy.  You may be disappointed like i was., Every renewed phone I’ve gotten before this one had a renewed battery. This one did not. Will have to get one soon, phone charge only last a few hours. Would not have bought it if I would have known the battery was not renewed., ok, It was good phone till a month after purchase kinda salty about it still wish i didnt spend on the phone also did not come with the right charger, I like the condition of the phone. It really looks as good as new.The problem is on the earphones plug. Should provide the adapter., The phone was ok. I had a few issues but nothing major., Gof a great product. Fast response, Phone worked great for about 6 months. Then it stopped connecting to the cellular service. Trying to update it and the phone says that I can’t. Called Apple support and they can’t do anything since phone is no longer under warranty., Everything was good except the battery came to me at 80% capacity.  So when it charges to 💯 it’s never better than 80%.  The seller offered me a 20.00 credit but I can’t find an authorized dealer to change the battery.  🤷‍♀️, This phone is almost perfect!!! The only thing about this device is that I can’t get it turned on due to the fact that it won’t accept a SIM card. I found this misleading due to the fact that they told me my device was renewed and compatible with certain carriers., Nice piece, My son loves it. Arrived quick, looks new, &amp; works great! He’s been smiling since, Received the phone in the usual blank white box refurbs come in, shipping was fast and it came with an android charger block and a no name lightning cable.Phone came with one long deep scratch, a cracked home button, and a couple other much smaller nicks and scratches, enough that it was off putting for me. Battery life showed 92% which is excellent however the phone did seem to lag after only my second week with it.Phone was unlocked as stated and I had no issues switching in my sim and using the phone right away. Overall a decent phone but I will be returning it because of the the cracked Touch ID button and deep scratches, The phone does not work properly it heats up so hot every time we try and use it ., Gift good condtion, A good way to get a new iPhone at a good price, The battery is useless, it takes 3 hours of use to fully recharge, needs to be replaced, All seemed as expected from the seller and from description except battery life was not 80% or above as stated in listing but 70%.The biggest issue with this was having to pay, send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promised.This just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending, then what else are they not checking with these phones., Didn’t come with any kind of paperwork and it’s working but the touchscreen can freeze up at times., Although i was very happy to get a much needed upgrade from my old 5s and this was just the right size there were a couple of things i was not satisfied with and almost sent the phone back. First of all Amazon stated the battery would be able to be charged at a minimum of 80% its original capacity mine was not it was around 75% i figured ok well i suppose i could live with that but amazon also states that there will be no visible blemishes on the phone viewed from 12 inches that was not the case with mine the finish on one of the rear corners about a half inch the entire corner of the phone was completely wore off once again i decided I could live with that since it is the rear and would be covered with the case. Overall im happy with the speed and functionality of the phone though and the screen camera and everything work great. I’m not happy that i will end up putting another 50 to 100 dollars into a phone that cost me about 200 in order to get a new full capacity battery that lasts longer for media and extended use, Daughter loves it, No fingerprints reader and the phone Glitches a lot, I was switching phones because the one I was using had a battery that was starting to die. However this one does just as quickly and got so hot it almost hurt to hold it., I just opened this product and charged it fully for two hours and unplugged it. As I’m sitting here on my old phone to port over my SIM card credentials, the battery went from 100 to 88% within 8 minutes. I just saw the numbers dropping right before my eyes. The phone transfer and condition are really good but the battery is terrible. I wish the guarantee included a new battery. (Health is reading at 83% out of the box)., The phone is very small., BATTERY LIFE NOT AS ADVERTISED  ONLY 56%NO ANSWER FROM SELLER, The phone looked good function well but was defective it had something loose inside and I had return it, I’d definitely buy again. This the real deal fr. Y’all should try them out! I got my money’s worth ., The battery life last about 2 to 3 hours., Great phone, defiantly recommend. It’s a little weird at times like it takes a while to turn on after it dies sometimes and I can’t have certain pictures as my screensaver for some reason. It would black out parts of it but I only had that problem with two of my pictures. Other than that for a refurbished phone it’s pretty good., I've boughten iPhones from amazon before, two different iPhone 6s. This time, I could only find iPhone 7, so if figured \"why not?\". I'll tell you why, this seller sent a defective phone. It worked perfectly the first day, and then 24 hours later it told me I needed to update it or else my cellular data wouldn't work (which means I could not receive or send any texts or calls!). Sure enough, I updated it, and it worked, for another few hours, until it said it needed ANOTHER UPDATE! Unfortunately, it was already up to date as it could be. So I took it in to the \"geniuses\" at APPLE, and they said THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH iPhone 7, YOU NEED TO REPLACE IT. And that was it. Returning, hopefully that goes smoothly. Avoid iPhone 7, too sketchy., excellent product</td>\n",

weeks but so far so good i even use it for visual control fpv on a few of my quadsdrones it is remarkable how well the battery holds up for that video on 1015 minute flights much better than my old iphone very glad i bought this runs slow colabirtation is off and screen glitches battery life is insufficient and less than expected phone came fast and everything is good but the battery only holds a charge for about an hour when it is not charging pretty annoyed about this bad battery life junk charger just buy new instead of having to do it anyways home button non functional was not bad came in good condition if i can fit everything i did not like about this phone into this box i would detail itbut whoever replaced the screen did a horrible jobwont register any sim cards to any carrierit looks like i bought it from wishcom there is a black line when trying to take pictures takes horrible pictures the phone is used and it does not earphones everything was great like brand new like many read a lot of bad reviews was worried that there would be major issues upon getting the phone however my phone showed up next day super fast opened up the packaging and the iphone 7 looked very very good couple very tiny scuffs but was expecting such as it is a used phone would give it a 910 and i am picky called my phone provider and they were able to switch it to my number no problem i have sprint which has merged with t mobile i got the fully unlocked phone for anyone wondering after running the phone through all its tests everything is in proper working order battery life is at 84 which is fine by me higher than the stated number of 80 anyways never really payed attention to that stuff on the other phones i have had all i can say is that the phone is doing everything it should and i am very happy with it if there is one concern the phone may be running a hair warm but nothing to seem worried about momentarily i will update this post at any point in the next 6 months if need be but so far so good company i went with tech exchangee ny screen had a small crack and a chip and the back has some marks on it and the home button is difficult to make contact however the phone does work cord does not work this device only worked for 6 months and it started decaying i send it to apple and they stated that it will need a new motherboard this was for personal use the phone has been nothing but trouble since the day we got it will not make calls or will make calls on its own we do not even when we are not even trying need to know if there is insurance on this purchase or is there any kind of warranty on this purchase item came without a charger i have been using my phone for about a month from what i have been able to assess so far the phone has been working properly the battery holds fairly well unless playing a game on the phone it drains the battery pretty quickly the siri function the finger print unlock and camera are pretty amazing and they are some of the many things that i did not have on my iphone 4so this is a wonderful upgrade for me very average product must have been used for couple of years before reselling it battery life was at 80 when arrived good purchase if one wants to buy iphone at cheap price phone works great i have to say no problems so far 55 have this phone just over six months it glitches turns off all the time battery drains fast phone will not shut off even when the battery is at 98 the amount of money i spent on it i should have gotten more than 6 months use would not recommend the phone barley work cannot call nobody cannot text nobody why it dies so fast it is ok it is a good phone over all but often freezes or hangs up calls on its own dies very fast annoying the stop working in 2 weeks extremely scratched and banged up should not have passed quality control unless the standards are that low perfect condition the battery on my other phone was only lasting me from 7 am 1 pm so i figured i would get a new phone the new phone is lasting from 7 am 11am and says the battery is 100 healthy worst purchase ever do not waste time on this item does not even turn on turns mad hot 1st day on arrival does not turn on 2nd day return hopefully all turn out good with money back update later on phone has no signal antenna broke internally on phone within 4 months just outside the 3 month return window worked great until then i liked it except for the fact that the back had some dints in it and you cannot turn it on silent mood look good speaker are not working arrived a day early which is usually nice but i planned my schedule around it arriving on the estimated delivery date it had obvious wear on the back and there was a small blotch on the screen that must have been dead pixels or something because it was pure white regardless of what was on the screen i did not like it in this condition so i returned it and they said they would deduct return shipping cost from my refund but they ended up not doing that the phone i received did not have a working microphone could not record or make calls the company issued me a full refund they have great customer service but sold a faulty device so i gave a neutral rating honestly i was so nervous to buy a phone from amazon for the 7 year old stepson but reviews can be very deceiving phone worked great now if i can only get this 7 year old to come back to earth and stay off the phone lol needles to say he loves it the phone does not work i can hear a person i call but they cannot hear me i loved this phone for about a half a year and loved it however i got a message saying my sim card could not be read turns out that this is a known iphone mistake when iphones are built when i brought it to the apple store they said that because it was originally made in japan they could not fix it or send me a new one i am now out for a new phone however it worked very well when it did i just would not risk it my battery dies way too soon the package also arrived much later than expected and also had a decent scratch in the screen deep enough to affect the overall appearance the camera works just as expected but it definitely was not the new look you can definitely see the precious wear and tear on the iphone no work for verizon great phone thank you i was confused by the packet i received with item it said iphone 5s i was ready to returni am a new iphone user i was kind of disappointed with charger not working had to buy additional one to use phone overall its a great item the phone was very nice looking phone but i had to return the phone due to it was not compatible with my sprint network service the phone constantly restarts itself the battery lasts all of 10 minutes i do not recommend buying a phone from this company they are junk i have only had this iphone 7 a few days the reason i bought it is because my previous iphone would not hold a charge for more than a few hours so far this iphone will hold a charge for 2 days with moderate use i am happy with it so far the charger that came with it did not work but i still have my previous iphone charger that did work other than that i am happy with it it did not have any scratches or anything and looks brand new this review is for the seller hybrid it first of all i was not expecting it to come as fast as it did i ordered my phone friday at 3 am and received it saturday by 12 pm that is kind of insane since they are in ny and i am in fl there are a few small scuffs on the bottom of the device near the speaker but otherwise it is pretty close to perfect cosmetically the screen has no scratches at all i cannot tell if it is the original but if it was replaced they did a hell of a job the max battery capacity is 100 it came with a charger but no headphones or headphone adapter so you will need to buy one i have not experienced any issues so far but it is only been a day so i will make sure to come back and give an updatealso if you have metro by tmobile and you are having trouble getting service after inserting your sim you have to register the phone with them before it will work not sure about other carriers for a second i thought i received a lockedstolen phone but i wanted to make sure do not give up unless the carrier actually tells you it will not work you can try calling the customer service number and doing it with the automated system or a representative but if you do not have access to your old phone you need to go into the store it took 5 minutes and only costs 1520 depending on where you liveoverall i am extremely pleased it was a risk but i am happy i seem to have gotten a good device thankful for all the reviews recommending to buy from this seller the maximum capacity of the battery was on 74 when i received the phone i can only use the phone for a few hours before the battery is completely dead other than them sending it with a bad battery the phone works great do not buy this phone i got this in today after looking for a good phone for my son for about 2 months the home button did not work and you cannot use verizon it is not amazon renewed its a scam phone is ok no marks or scratches but came with outdated ios that needed to be updated prior to transferring data from old phone battery life is not great there are times when a phone is set to support another carrier and even after a full factory reset any carrier update will kill your mobile network happened to me sprinttmobile reset it and tried multiple times and every time we got it to work it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a daythat means no calls no text no internet if you are outside of wifibe warned and keep your old phone handy you may be disappointed like i was every renewed phone i have gotten before this one had a renewed battery this one did not will have to get one soon phone charge only last a few hours would not have bought it if i would have known the battery was not renewed ok it was good phone till a month after purchase kind of salty about it still wish i did not spend on the phone also did not come with the right charger i like the condition of the phone it really looks as good as newthe problem is on the earphones plug should provide the adapter the phone was ok i had a few issues but nothing major gof a great product fast response phone worked great for about 6 months then it stopped connecting to the cellular service trying to update it and the phone says that i cannot called apple support and they cannot do anything since phone is no longer under warranty everything was good except the battery came to me at 80 capacity so when it charges to it is never better than 80 the seller offered me a 2000 credit but i cannot find an authorized dealer to change the battery this phone is almost perfect the only thing about this device is that i cannot get it turned on due to the fact that it will not accept a sim card i found this misleading due to the fact that they told me my device was renewed and compatible with certain carriers nice piece my son loves it arrived quick looks new works great he is been smiling since received the phone in the usual blank white box refurbs come in shipping was fast and it came with an android charger block and a no name lightning cablephone came with one long deep scratch a cracked home button and a couple other much smaller nicks and scratches enough that it was off putting for me battery life showed 92 which is excellent however the phone did seem to lag after only my second week with itphone was unlocked as stated and i had no issues switching in my sim and using the phone right away overall a decent phone but i will be returning it because of the the cracked touch id button and deep scratches the phone does not work properly it heats up so hot every time we try and use it gift good condtion a good way to get a new iphone at a good price the battery is useless it takes 3 hours of use to fully recharge needs to be replaced all seemed as expected from the seller and from description except battery life was not 80 or above as stated in listing but 70the biggest issue with this was having to pay send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promisedthis just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending then what else are they not checking with these phones did not come with any kind of paperwork and it is working but the touchscreen can freeze up at times although i was very happy to get a much needed upgrade from my old 5s and this was just the right size there were a couple of things i was not satisfied with and almost sent the phone back first of all amazon stated the battery would be able to be charged at a minimum of 80 its original capacity mine was not it was around 75 i figured ok well i suppose i could live with that but amazon also states that there will be no visible blemishes on the phone viewed from 12 inches that was not the case with mine the finish on one of the rear corners about a half inch the entire corner of the phone was completely wore off once again i decided i could live with that since it is the rear and would be covered with the case overall i am happy with the speed and functionality of the phone though and the screen camera and everything work great i am not happy that i will end up putting another 50 to 100 dollars into a phone that cost me about 200 in order to get a new full capacity battery that lasts longer for media and extended use daughter loves it no fingerprints reader and the phone glitches a lot i was switching phones because the one i was using had a battery that was starting to die however this one does just as quickly and got so hot it almost hurt to hold it i just opened this product and charged it fully for two hours and unplugged it as i am sitting here on my old phone to port over my sim card credentials the battery went from 100 to 88 within 8 minutes i just saw the numbers dropping right before my eyes the phone transfer and condition are really good but the battery is terrible i wish the guarantee included a new battery health is reading at 83 out of the box the phone is very small battery life not as advertised only 56no answer from seller the phone looked good function well but was defective it had something loose inside and i had return it i would definitely buy again this the real deal fr you all should try them out i got my moneys worth the battery life last about 2 to 3 hours great phone defiantly recommend it is a little weird at times like it takes a while to turn on after it dies sometimes and i cannot have certain pictures as my screensaver for some reason it would black out parts of it but i only had that problem with two of my pictures other than that for a refurbished phone it is pretty good i have boughten iphones from amazon before two different iphone 6s this time i could only find iphone 7 so if figured why not i will tell you why this seller sent a defective phone it worked perfectly the first day and then 24 hours later it told me i needed to update it or else my cellular data would not work which means i could not receive or send any texts or calls sure enough i updated it and it worked for another few hours until it said it needed another update unfortunately it was already up to date as it could be so i took it in to the geniuses at apple and they said this is a common problem with iphone 7 you need to replace it and that was it returning hopefully that goes smoothly avoid iphone 7 too sketchy excellent product</td>\n",

       "      <td>It’s thick, but works good once you get used to it!, These base and top coats work great for an at home gel mani-pedi. My only issue was when i tried to soak and scrape it off, it seemed like the base layer bonded almost TOO well with my nail, and part of my nail layers scraped off. I had to take a few months break between the next gel manicure because my nails were damaged. This could just be user error or the fact that my nails are extremely thin. They held up great though, and looked beautiful., the product works great, the only reason i didn’t give five stars was because it smells TERRIBLE. like a skunk almost and it’s very strong. but it works, and works well., I would buy it again. Beats having to use nail polish remover in the end. Best quality I’ve ever used at home. Nails come out looking professional. Very easy to use. I recommend it., smells awful, While the polish is great, every bottle I've ever had from them, 4, ALL HAVE LEAKED when on their side., I love this product it’s very easy and it last for 14 days, Best brand for top coat and base!! My favorite one, Terrible product. The base coat seemed to work fine, but the top coat was in such a gel-like consistency that I couldn't even use it. No matter how hard I shook the bottle up, it remained the same. Waste of money. Only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the base coat worked. All in all, NOT HAPPY!!!, The base coat is horrible. You’re better off just buying the top coat only. Top coat is average I would say. I’ve done my manicures without the base and they come out better. The base causes the polish to look bumpy., Really cool that I can do this at home. Just light and done!, My top coat bottle came completely empty. I am returning for a replacement but it’s disappointing!, Poor quality, was only good the first few uses. Base coat became thick and does not go on smoothly at all. Product quality changes over very short time. Would not recommend. Both me and my sister are allergic to this product. After some use it causes nail bed pain and inflammation., It's great that you take a picture... but it helps if you show the door # !!! This was dropped off at 104!? NOT 106, I could not get the base coat to dry fully.  I used my UV light 5 times (5 min) and it was still tacky.  I gave up and went ahead and put polish over it anyway.  The polish I used thankfully was able to dry just fine.  The top coat seemed to dry much better but I won't be using this brand again., Overall this is a good set. It can be thick so be sure to wipe the brush on the side of the bottle before applying and when covering your nail. Make sure to use thinner coats and apply evenly or else you’ll see the lines/uneven levels after curing.For curing times, I have a UV LED lamp and wasn’t sure how long to cure for. Top coat 60 seconds is perfect. Cures hard and comes off easily when time to remove. For base coat I tried 60 seconds but was having a hard time when removing it, so I went down to 30 seconds and that seems to have helped., Top coat dried out in the bottle after 3 uses. Returned!, Perfect, Bottles came leaking from the top. The gel polish I got to go along with these two bottles was perfectly fine and intact. Why these leaked I don’t know. I haven’t used them yet either since most of the product was all over the box it came in., Top coat goes on nicely and leaves a nice shinny coat and is not sticky., Pretty easy to come because the polish came off within a week. I would have expected it to last at least 2 weeks., Very small but not too bad, Nice, not that good, This product worked amazingly well. After a minute under LED /UV it was dry. Very sheer and worked well with my polygel kit., First time trying this brand and my last. Very, very thin like a refusal polish, not hard at all. Nails broke easily. I do not recommend this brand., Great product, Amazing! Lasts the longest out of anything I’ve tried!, This is a peel off formula. I do follow all the instructions for application and I never use acetone to remove. I soak in water for a few minutes or just hand wash some dishes and I am able to peel of the polish most times I one piece. Now while that its awesome because it removes easily, the manicure does not last past 2 days with out major chipping., I used it the first time and it worked real good! but the second time was horrible, I could not get it to set correctly, it was in a way clumpy? it sucks because I really wanted to like it., Horrible product. Does not stay on. The top coat has a thick glue like consistency and does not spread on nail well. Peels off within a couple of days. So disappointed., Is just a oil, It is clumpy and didn’t even dry all the way through, now my nails are smudged.Está muy gruesa y no se secaron bien mis uñas., I ordered the base &amp; top coat about 4 years ago &amp; I loved it. I started doing my own nails again so I wanted to try it again...bad idea. The base coat works fine but the top coat started clumping &amp; was too thick &amp; this was only the first use. Maybe they’ve changed the polish since the last time I used it but I won’t be ordering it again., Works fine doesn’t last too long though., The base coat good, but the top coat is trash! Starts peeling the next day., Great base and tip coat!! Lasts atleast 3 weeks for me!!, Not even an Ounce, I have tried various steps in an effort to get this polish to last longer than 7 days. It doesn't matter what I do it chips and looks like crap and has to be changed by day 7. I bought this base and top with Amelie gel polish., The topcoat got extremely clumpy after the second use causing an unsmooth finish., I was super excited to get my gel polishes in with such fantastic ratings- unfortunately the product was so thick when i went to apply, it applied like a literal paste.  There is no good use for this polish and I would like a refund promptly., I love the no wipe too coat. Saves me some time., This brand doesn’t hold up, the shellac peels off a lot sooner then expected., seriously soooo good! i do my own gel nails/toes at home and this is by far the best set i’ve gotten. gel polish is definitely an art and takes a long time to master - if this set “lifts” you probably just aren’t doing your gel application correctly. these two are excellent! also added bonus you don’t need to wipe the top coat :), The item itself is good but the bottles are very very tiny. I wish they made them a little bigger for the price., This does what it says it will do and the top coat is not sticky at all when it sets. The only complaint I have is that if you try to close the bottle when there is polish on the brush and the polish gets onto the mouth of the bottle, the cap will actually shrink wrap onto the mouth of the bottle making it very hard to open! This has happened to me several times so now I make sure there is no polish on the outside of the mouth of the bottle and I try to close it very gently not tightly. Please be aware of how you close this nail polish otherwise it will take FOREVER TO OPEN when you want to use it again., I really loved this product for the first few months! But recently began to have an allergic reaction to the product! I'm bummed I have to switch it up now because its great quality. Not saying don't buy it-- but definitely be mindful!, Very good product. Will buy again., applies and cures well, but dulls your manicure significantly. Also the base coat is difficult to remove., Bought for my sister who does nails and she didn’t like it... sadly, I like the product it’s a good shine and it lasts about two weeks I was pleased., The gel has a murky purple coating during the day time. It glows green under UV light.  When comparing this top coat to my Kupa inc Top coat there is a huge difference in color. Kupa inc top coat is clear and the Aimeli has the Murky Purple coating., So in love with this gel. It is thick and gets into all the nooks and crannies. It was actually recommended by a nail tech on you tube (nailed by nikki) and I had to try.  So far I am loving this product!!! If you don't like thick gel this is not for you but trudt you won't regret this buy., Top coat does not wear well. Base coat works great!, Dislike, Great base and top coat for gel nails, Not bad I've ordered it several times wish they would sell a matte top gel with these too, I was scared at first because it Was still tacky after curing under UV light but I read it’s supposed to be so polish will stick. Continued with my nail routine and it turned out well! Really great product especially for the price!!, Great for beginners. Works well, I brought the polish the size of the bottle for what you pay is pretty small I don’t blink your eyes, This chips and peels off, about like regular nail polish.  It is nothing like \"gel nails\" that you get in the salon, which is what I was looking for., Top coat turns yellow after a few days. I have used the base and top coat 4 times so far, and every time my nails start turning yellow after a few days. I have tried different curing times and even wiped the top coat after, but nothing seems to fix it. This has never happened with other brands of gel top coat I have used., Worked pretty good, good product for the price ! I usually get opi but this did the job, This was great for the price. Only issue was it did chip in some nails but that may have been true to operator error, I may not have cured the polish long enough. All in all I’m happy with my purchase. Also, arrived a lot sooner than I had anticipated., This! I can’t even begin! This is an amazing base and top coat my nails lasted! It was easy to use, and great for gels!I love it, This is my first gel base and top coat so I really don't have anything to compare it to., This must be a cheaper brand or the base coat is just bad. I have been using file off gel polish and I was noticing that I have a problem not damaging my nail when filing it off. It wasn't killing my nails, but I figured soak off would case me to do less accidental damage.I bought this brand because it was prime available and somewhat inexpensive. In a week I have had two nails (one on each hand) peel completely off. Its not like the free edge got loose. It just was really lifted in the middle or edge where it frowns in, and the loose polish would get peeled up to an awkward place where I had to remove it or it would peel even more off the top layer of my nails. One happened in just 3 days. THREE DAYS. I fixed those two jankity nails and I also added a second coat of just the top coat to all of my nails after 1 week. I can't tell if the top coat is better or not.Now this does have a perk. Its super easy to soak off and remove. Like wow it removes like butter. But, if its coming off super easy because it falls off of a well prepped nail in less than a week, this is a problem. I can now see why this has some lower ratings and why people would spend at least double on a widely known US name brand. Will I use the rest of teh bottle? Yes. I am cheap! I also like changing my nail polish color frequently if I can pull that off. This soaks off so easy that I could totally change my polish all the time. But, it also just falls off which means when I am too busy to do a manicure once a week this just flat out sucks.Edit: I have updated this review because after sitting and soaking off the polish I am really happy with how my nails look. They aren't damaged or sad looking. It really did just bubble up and off. This wouldn't be my choice for wearing before going on vacation or trying to wear for weeks in a row since it doesn't bubble up and come off easily, but if you like to change your nail color a couple of times a week you will be happy with this polish.8/8 Update: I keep trying this base/top coat FOOLISHLY because I have it. It keeps performing poorly. Polish just pops off within a day or two of application.  Just spend more and get Gelish. Even with shrinkage at least it stays on the nail better. Its my own fault for trying it again, but good grief., Peels easy, This basecoat is whack. Upon applying it, it’s separated like crazy. When I applied my gel color over top it also would separate on top until the second or third layer when it evened out. The topcoat is great, not tacky once it’s been cured and works as advertised., Top coat and base coat is very thick hard to apply thin.  Took forever to cure and was sticky had to put under the led light a lot longer than suggested to cure and then my thumb completely peeled off, This is the worst gel I've ever used. Doesnt really fully harden.  Peels off. Not durable at all. Do not reccommend!!, Not good dont buy this, This item is a great price for the two bottles. And it a product that I like because of the no wipe top coat, and it give a nice shiny finish., Easy to use and has a nice longevity! Impressed with the quality., Not so well, I used this base and top coat with the Gellen polish brand. This stuff works great- top coat is very glossy and dries fast with the UV lamp. Like instantly dry. I’ve had these nails for 2 weeks and the gloss wore off a smidge but that’s expected after 2 weeks. Still hasn’t chipped or lost ALL glossiness. I recommended this brand to 2 friends. Overall great purchase! I will be buying the colors next., I am reasonably new to gel nails and this was my first set of top and base, which I bought as Amazon reccommended it. I am fully aware of how long it takes to remove gel, but this stuff DOES NOT COME OFF. An hour of working at it every manicure with sandpaper, bowls of acetone, and wraps, and it just does not budge. Yet, it manages to lift along my cuticle line after a week and a half. Buy something higher quality and experiment with inexpensive gel colors. Lesson learned., I do like this but do not get to close to the sides of your nail. It will peel up. I can get it to last 7 to 10 days so I guess it's not to bad. Its not easy to take off unless it is peeling up. I am by no means a pro with my nails so it could totally be something that I am doing wrong but for the price it's not a bad product., Great quality for the price. Convenient that you don’t have to use rubbing alcohol after use. My nails stay on really well using the base and top coat. Used with uv light., look nice but the nail polish only last like 4 days., Liked this product and the cost is fair. I have used name brands that have cost more and this brand is equivalent., Bottles were broken at the cap. Bottles spilled out the contents. Was not able to be used. Very disappointed, This is my favorite base &amp; top coat set. I definitely wish that they made bigger bottles or maybe a refill bottle because I literally have to order a new set every week. I go through them too quickly and having the option to just refill my bottle would be so amazing., I really like this base/ top coat but it does leave almost a blue tint to the polish sometimes or it can be streaky., I am new to the DIY UV lamp. This is a must have for UV gel! Make sure your nails are clean and dry before you put the base coat (wiping with alcohol works well). Would recommend and buy again, Not a big fan of this. The base coat never dries (which I know is kind of okay cause it's a base coat) but overall it just takes forever under the lamp. And by that time things like dust get stuck in the polish so it's weird., Was old, Really smooth and shiny but it has a really strong smell, Bought for a friend and she said it's the best she's used this far. I'll stick to the Beetles brand but it's good to know there's an alternative that works well if necessary., good, This top coat sucks. It gets so cloudy and it doesn’t shine, I bought this as my first gel base and top coat. Polish lasted the average two week which was great. However, no matter how careful I applied it, it always left imperfections. Like it shrinks when it sets up under the light. Perfect and smooth going on. Ripples when dried. I tried it with many different colors/brands and always got the same result. I will stick to my new favorite CNC Shellac. Perfect every time, Used it twice. By the second time, the product had already become a useless gooey substance.Waste of money., I work whole day and full time mom and this works great lasts 10 days!, Easy to apply, Received today and not sure if this is oldProduct but I can’t get the top coat bottle open not sure but it’s definitely defective, You NEED the no wipe top for any of their polishes., I use plenty top coat but this is the worst by far, Works great., Pretty nice polish., After using this product as instructed I realized that the topcoat comes off way too easy. I am not happy with it. I do like the builder gel but other than that I do not like this product, My base coat takes a longer time to dry other than that will by again, Love the colors but peels off ez on natural nails, This set is really nice and works well for acrylic nails. Be warned that on natural nails the top coat burns when cured. Otherwise this product is awesome., Trash !!, I love the base and top coat the only problem I’ve had is that the top coat came really lumpy but I’ve been working through it and just wiping the clumps off as I work. But over all they’re both great and last., i love how it goes on----i got so excited i ordered more----but it chips after a few days---am so very disappointed in that---would not buy again----now that i already have!!!, bought it as a result of all them better tthan positive reviews, i was not at all disappointed! definitely recommended with no reservations!, Long lasting, but a few cons. The product is very runny so you have to be careful, otherwise you'll have a lot of clean up around your cuticles to do before curing. I didn't have issues with peeling or chipping until a couple weeks later, so that's a plus. The biggest con for me was the removal. I'm not sure this is really \"soak off\". I soak cotton balls in 100% pure acetone and wrap in foil. After 40 minutes, only the top coat budged.... A little. My gel polish, another brand, peeled off very easily, but underneath the base coat was hard as a rock. This is the same thing that happens when I use my regular gel polish top coat and forget that it has to filed off and accidentally soak them., I love a good base and top coat but I do not want it to be so thick. This product is much thicker than any I have used so far and I had a lot of bubbling on my nail and for these reasons I am passing on future purchases., I've been using these for years. Seems like the formula changed lately. Less shiny, doesn't have the same look under the LED light. Not sure how it will hold up., Top coat was clumpy. Purchased 2 x happened to both top coats, The top coat was not going on well.  I had to replace the top coat with a different brand but I still use the base coat, The base coat works quite well (difficult to remove it though), but after 1 or 2 uses the top coat doesn’t work very well at all. It bubbles like crazy leaving a polka dot texture,  and my nails start chipping after 4 or 5 days of wear. Would not recommend., Functionally decent. They smell atrocious though, more so than any nail product I've smelled in my life. Acrylic smells better than this stuff, it's like burning plastic straight from the bottle. Needs over 60 seconds under UV to set but that's not a huge deal., I don’t know what I’ve been doing wrong, if anything, but the base coat cures in a weird way. It will almost bubble and shrink to one side of my nail. I thought it was my technique or lamp, but I later found out it wasn’t the case. The top coat is pretty solid though, so I’ll keep using that., I was so excited about finding a cheaper alternative to the Sally Hansen brand - but the first time I stuck my hands in any water, the top coat chipped right off and looked awful. Also took a long time to cure., It's cheap, but you should probably just pay a bit more for a better top coat., Nice gel. As expected., Applies well, dries well with my lamp, is no wipe. My only complaint is that it doesn't get thick or strong enough., This product works for maybe a day or 2 but after that it peels off or chips easily. So with that being said it definitely easy to remove lol. Would recommend just spending the money on a better product that might cost more. You will save yourself time!, I've had these for some time now. I do prefer this formula over other brands, HOWEVER, after using for a while, the outside of the bottles gets extremely sticky. There is still plenty of polish left over in the bottle, so I hate to throw it away, but I might have to replace them because I can't stand the feeling. Other than that, everything is great. Just make sure that you keep them upright all the time and be careful when using., This is amazing product., Love this product works great cures in 30secs. Would recommend 2 anyone who wants stronger lasting 💅 nails, Polish started chipping on day 1. To be fair, it may have been the UV lamp I was using because I think it was defective; hence the extra 2 stars., I love that you don't have to wipe the topcoat, but no matter how long I soak my nails… The basecoat will not come off! I have excellent soak off fingernail  polish remover, But the basecoat will not come off  all of the way . I'm going to have to sand it off my nails., Wow! This stuff lasts a very long time, however it took me 3 separate times of soaking my nails with acetone to remove the top coat at 20 minutes each time. I buffed my nails first to scratch it too. It might be easier to let the polish grow out! The top coat polish keeps its shine for entire time. This stuff lasts a long time.The base coat didn't even come off, so I just buffed it off with my nail file.I want to give this a great review, the price is so good, it's just so darn hard to remove. I like the other polish colors, but just will use my other brand base and top coats instead., Polish was awful, it was thick and difficult to apply because it didn’t flow from the brush...it globbed. I did use the curing light-thinking it might kind of smooth out a bit??  and it took 4-5 mins  (supposed to take ONE minute!!)  to make it “seem” ok but it never did completely dry. HUGE waste of my money and my time, The top coat is amazing! I love it. The base coat is weird (minus a star).  You have to put a super EVEN coat on the whole nail and it can’t be too thin of a layer because it becomes uneven. You have to use just the right amount. Anyway, it makes me wonder if the base coat is even necessary. Also, the base coat doesn’t dry hard after the lamp. It’s a bit sticky so don’t touch it. That’s supposedly normal though., I have mixed feelings about this product. The first time I  used the polish it was amazing!! But the next time I used it it was like the top coat was setting/hardening on the brush. I pulled that clump off and then went on it worked just as the first time. But then when I go to use it the 3rd time there is little hard pieces all over the brush. The was no sticky film once you cure it under the light. I just wish I for more uses out of it rather than looking like 3... I've used many gel polishes but this is the first to do this. I may have gotten a bad batch or something. I really like the base coat I have had no problem with the my polish coming off of my nail., Sticky, very sticky, I don’t feel like it is quite as shiney  as previous ones I have purchased, Pretty good.  Once dry there are no problems with chipping or peeling.  But need to take extra time under the UV lamp.  I've used two different brand lamps and both take a while to dry.  So, be patient and you have a great polish., I've used several different base and top coats but when I used this one it started peeling off after 3 days. Nice shine but that's a bummer., Doesnt stay on., Really shiny, easy to use, but for some reasons, it turns yellow after a couple days (3-4)., I've been sandwhiching my my old polish with great success. Lasts over a week, I haven't waited for it to chip to remove.I don't notice any funky smell like other reviewers.I have to say though, the base coat is difficult to remove. I have to do a second round of buffing and soaking to get it off, and still have to buff of the remnants.PS. You have to let your nail polish dry before you put on the top coat or it will never dry!, Will buy again, Leaked everywhere. Such a mess. Had to throwaway., VERY disappointed in this product. I have used a better top and base coat in the past and repurchased those instead. I missed the cut off to return it, but I honestly would. It didn’t last more than a week!, This base coat was unbelievably bad.  It applied smoothly (to freshly washed &amp; cleaned nails that had been wiped clean of residue with alcohol), then as it cured it drew together into raised rivulets, leaving other parts of the nails completely bare. It also went spiky, with little points all over it that gave it a texture like there was sand mixed in. Needless to say, this did not provide a smooth canvas for my manicure, and when two coats of gel polish over it still couldn’t completely smooth it out, my only choice was to put a glitter overcoat over everything to camouflage it. So unimpressed!, Love ,love ,love. Very easy to apply and the topcoat is amazing. Week 3 and no chips on my nails. I have tried many other products,  but this is the BEST.  Highly recommend., TerribleQuality, make sure you are sober when you put it on the first. it's more difficult than regular polish, but it is 100% worth it,  very great colors and it last a lot longer., Base is not good. Top coat does cure pretty quickly but they really don't help the gel stay on longer as my gel chipped the next day. Was pretty annoyed at that., Good quality, very shiny but to little of product, I am glad I bought these but the top coat has been leaking a bit out of the top so it won’t last as long as I’d like but I still am pretty glad I bought it! And the price isn’t bad either!, I love this brand these are amazing, Unlike some name brand's, this product is too soft and allows your nails to tear. And peels off way too easy., It's ok I trying better that keep your nail polish on. More two day sad I have to do my nails very two days cause of product isn't good. Not worth the money., Excellent base &amp; top coat. Makes my nails really shiny and hard and my polish last for 2+ weeks. But it does seem to dent if you push your nail or something sharp into it and for that I’m removing one start. Removal is easy too with a 180 grit file., I gave it 2 star's because the base coat get hard at all so I order a different kind I hope it works better, Bad quality, I use gel polish that does not require a base coat, so I only use the top coat. It dries down nice and hard and does not have a sticky finish. My biggest complaint is that the top coat almost separates, and does not provide an even finish. Does the job, for the most part.</td>\n",
       "      <td>it is thick but works good once you get used to it these base and top coats work great for an at home gel manipedi my only issue was when i tried to soak and scrape it off it seemed like the base layer bonded almost too well with my nail and part of my nail layers scraped off i had to take a few months break between the next gel manicure because my nails were damaged this could just be user error or the fact that my nails are extremely thin they held up great though and looked beautiful the product works great the only reason i did not give five stars was because it smells terrible like a skunk almost and it is very strong but it works and works well i would buy it again beats having to use nail polish remover in the end best quality i have ever used at home nails come out looking professional very easy to use i recommend it smells awful while the polish is great every bottle i have ever had from them 4 all have leaked when on their side i love this product it is very easy and it last for 14 days best brand for top coat and base my favorite one terrible product the base coat seemed to work fine but the top coat was in such a gellike consistency that i could not even use it no matter how hard i shook the bottle up it remained the same waste of money only reason i gave it two stars instead of one is because the base coat worked all in all not happy the base coat is horrible you are better off just buying the top coat only top coat is average i would say i have done my manicures without the base and they come out better the base causes the polish to look bumpy really cool that i can do this at home just light and done my top coat bottle came completely empty i am returning for a replacement but it is disappointing poor quality was only good the first few uses base coat became thick and does not go on smoothly at all product quality changes over very short time would not recommend both me and my sister are allergic to this product after some use it causes nail bed pain and inflammation it is great that you take a picture but it helps if you show the door this was dropped off at 104 not 106 i could not get the base coat to dry fully i used my uv light 5 times 5 min and it was still tacky i gave up and went ahead and put polish over it anyway the polish i used thankfully was able to dry just fine the top coat seemed to dry much better but i will not be using this brand again overall this is a good set it can be thick so be sure to wipe the brush on the side of the bottle before applying and when covering your nail make sure to use thinner coats and apply evenly or else you will see the linesuneven levels after curingfor curing times i have a uv led lamp and was not sure how long to cure for top coat 60 seconds is perfect cures hard and comes off easily when time to remove for base coat i tried 60 seconds but was having a hard time when removing it so i went down to 30 seconds and that seems to have helped top coat dried out in the bottle after 3 uses returned perfect bottles came leaking from the top the gel polish i got to go along with these two bottles was perfectly fine and intact why these leaked i do not know i have not used them yet either since most of the product was all over the box it came in top coat goes on nicely and leaves a nice shinny coat and is not sticky pretty easy to come because the polish came off within a week i would have expected it to last at least 2 weeks very small but not too bad nice not that good this product worked amazingly well after a minute under led uv it was dry very sheer and worked well with my polygel kit first time trying this brand and my last very very thin like a refusal polish not hard at all nails broke easily i do not recommend this brand great product amazing lasts the longest out of anything i have tried this is a peel off formula i do follow all the instructions for application and i never use acetone to remove i soak in water for a few minutes or just hand wash some dishes and i am able to peel of the polish most times i one piece now while that its awesome because it removes easily the manicure does not last past 2 days with out major chipping i used it the first time and it worked real good but the second time was horrible i could not get it to set correctly it was in a way clumpy it sucks because i really wanted to like it horrible product does not stay on the top coat has a thick glue like consistency and does not spread on nail well peels off within a couple of days so disappointed is just a oil it is clumpy and did not even dry all the way through now my nails are smudgedestá muy gruesa y no se secaron bien mis youñas i ordered the base top coat about 4 years ago i loved it i started doing my own nails again so i wanted to try it againbad idea the base coat works fine but the top coat started clumping was too thick this was only the first use maybe they have changed the polish since the last time i used it but i will not be ordering it again works fine does not last too long though the base coat good but the top coat is trash starts peeling the next day great base and tip coat lasts atleast 3 weeks for me not even an ounce i have tried various steps in an effort to get this polish to last longer than 7 days it does not matter what i do it chips and looks like crap and has to be changed by day 7 i bought this base and top with amelie gel polish the topcoat got extremely clumpy after the second use causing an unsmooth finish i was super excited to get my gel polishes in with such fantastic ratings unfortunately the product was so thick when i went to apply it applied like a literal paste there is no good use for this polish and i would like a refund promptly i love the no wipe too coat saves me some time this brand does not hold up the shellac peels off a lot sooner then expected seriously soooo good i do my own gel nailstoes at home and this is by far the best set i have gotten gel polish is definitely an art and takes a long time to master if this set lifts you probably just are not doing your gel application correctly these two are excellent also added bonus you do not need to wipe the top coat the item itself is good but the bottles are very very tiny i wish they made them a little bigger for the price this does what it says it will do and the top coat is not sticky at all when it sets the only complaint i have is that if you try to close the bottle when there is polish on the brush and the polish gets onto the mouth of the bottle the cap will actually shrink wrap onto the mouth of the bottle making it very hard to open this has happened to me several times so now i make sure there is no polish on the outside of the mouth of the bottle and i try to close it very gently not tightly please be aware of how you close this nail polish otherwise it will take forever to open when you want to use it again i really loved this product for the first few months but recently began to have an allergic reaction to the product i am bummed i have to switch it up now because its great quality not saying do not buy it but definitely be mindful very good product will buy again applies and cures well but dulls your manicure significantly also the base coat is difficult to remove bought for my sister who does nails and she did not like it sadly i like the product it is a good shine and it lasts about two weeks i was pleased the gel has a murky purple coating during the day time it glows green under uv light when comparing this top coat to my kupa inc top coat there is a huge difference in color kupa inc top coat is clear and the aimeli has the murky purple coating so in love with this gel it is thick and gets into all the nooks and crannies it was actually recommended by a nail tech on you tube nailed by nikki and i had to try so far i am loving this product if you do not like thick gel this is not for you but trudt you will not regret this buy top coat does not wear well base coat works great dislike great base and top coat for gel nails not bad i have ordered it several times wish they would sell a matte top gel with these too i was scared at first because it was still tacky after curing under uv light but i read it is supposed to be so polish will stick continued with my nail routine and it turned out well really great product especially for the price great for beginners works well i brought the polish the size of the bottle for what you pay is pretty small i do not blink your eyes this chips and peels off about like regular nail polish it is nothing like gel nails that you get in the salon which is what i was looking for top coat turns yellow after a few days i have used the base and top coat 4 times so far and every time my nails start turning yellow after a few days i have tried different curing times and even wiped the top coat after but nothing seems to fix it this has never happened with other brands of gel top coat i have used worked pretty good good product for the price i usually get opi but this did the job this was great for the price only issue was it did chip in some nails but that may have been true to operator error i may not have cured the polish long enough all in all i am happy with my purchase also arrived a lot sooner than i had anticipated this i cannot even begin this is an amazing base and top coat my nails lasted it was easy to use and great for gelsi love it this is my first gel base and top coat so i really do not have anything to compare it to this must be a cheaper brand or the base coat is just bad i have been using file off gel polish and i was noticing that i have a problem not damaging my nail when filing it off it was not killing my nails but i figured soak off would case me to do less accidental damagei bought this brand because it was prime available and somewhat inexpensive in a week i have had two nails one on each hand peel completely off its not like the free edge got loose it just was really lifted in the middle or edge where it frowns in and the loose polish would get peeled up to an awkward place where i had to remove it or it would peel even more off the top layer of my nails one happened in just 3 days three days i fixed those two jankity nails and i also added a second coat of just the top coat to all of my nails after 1 week i cannot tell if the top coat is better or notnow this does have a perk its super easy to soak off and remove like wow it removes like butter but if its coming off super easy because it falls off of a well prepped nail in less than a week this is a problem i can now see why this has some lower ratings and why people would spend at least double on a widely known us name brand will i use the rest of teh bottle yes i am cheap i also like changing my nail polish color frequently if i can pull that off this soaks off so easy that i could totally change my polish all the time but it also just falls off which means when i am too busy to do a manicure once a week this just flat out sucksedit i have updated this review because after sitting and soaking off the polish i am really happy with how my nails look they are not damaged or sad looking it really did just bubble up and off this would not be my choice for wearing before going on vacation or trying to wear for weeks in a row since it does not bubble up and come off easily but if you like to change your nail color a couple of times a week you will be happy with this polish88 update i keep trying this basetop coat foolishly because i have it it keeps performing poorly polish just pops off within a day or two of application just spend more and get gelish even with shrinkage at least it stays on the nail better its my own fault for trying it again but good grief peels easy this basecoat is whack upon applying it it is separated like crazy when i applied my gel color over top it also would separate on top until the second or third layer when it evened out the topcoat is great not tacky once it is been cured and works as advertised top coat and base coat is very thick hard to apply thin took forever to cure and was sticky had to put under the led light a lot longer than suggested to cure and then my thumb completely peeled off this is the worst gel i have ever used does not really fully harden peels off not durable at all do not reccommend not good do not buy this this item is a great price for the two bottles and it a product that i like because of the no wipe top coat and it give a nice shiny finish easy to use and has a nice longevity impressed with the quality not so well i used this base and top coat with the gellen polish brand this stuff works great top coat is very glossy and dries fast with the uv lamp like instantly dry i have had these nails for 2 weeks and the gloss wore off a smidge but that is expected after 2 weeks still has not chipped or lost all glossiness i recommended this brand to 2 friends overall great purchase i will be buying the colors next i am reasonably new to gel nails and this was my first set of top and base which i bought as amazon reccommended it i am fully aware of how long it takes to remove gel but this stuff does not come off an hour of working at it every manicure with sandpaper bowls of acetone and wraps and it just does not budge yet it manages to lift along my cuticle line after a week and a half buy something higher quality and experiment with inexpensive gel colors lesson learned i do like this but do not get to close to the sides of your nail it will peel up i can get it to last 7 to 10 days so i guess it is not to bad its not easy to take off unless it is peeling up i am by no means a pro with my nails so it could totally be something that i am doing wrong but for the price it is not a bad product great quality for the price convenient that you do not have to use rubbing alcohol after use my nails stay on really well using the base and top coat used with uv light look nice but the nail polish only last like 4 days liked this product and the cost is fair i have used name brands that have cost more and this brand is equivalent bottles were broken at the cap bottles spilled out the contents was not able to be used very disappointed this is my favorite base top coat set i definitely wish that they made bigger bottles or maybe a refill bottle because i literally have to order a new set every week i go through them too quickly and having the option to just refill my bottle would be so amazing i really like this base top coat but it does leave almost a blue tint to the polish sometimes or it can be streaky i am new to the diy uv lamp this is a must have for uv gel make sure your nails are clean and dry before you put the base coat wiping with alcohol works well would recommend and buy again not a big fan of this the base coat never dries which i know is kind of okay because it is a base coat but overall it just takes forever under the lamp and by that time things like dust get stuck in the polish so it is weird was old really smooth and shiny but it has a really strong smell bought for a friend and she said it is the best she is used this far i will stick to the beetles brand but it is good to know there is an alternative that works well if necessary good this top coat sucks it gets so cloudy and it does not shine i bought this as my first gel base and top coat polish lasted the average two week which was great however no matter how careful i applied it it always left imperfections like it shrinks when it sets up under the light perfect and smooth going on ripples when dried i tried it with many different colorsbrands and always got the same result i will stick to my new favorite cnc shellac perfect every time used it twice by the second time the product had already become a useless gooey substancewaste of money i work whole day and full time mom and this works great lasts 10 days easy to apply received today and not sure if this is oldproduct but i cannot get the top coat bottle open not sure but it is definitely defective you need the no wipe top for any of their polishes i use plenty top coat but this is the worst by far works great pretty nice polish after using this product as instructed i realized that the topcoat comes off way too easy i am not happy with it i do like the builder gel but other than that i do not like this product my base coat takes a longer time to dry other than that will by again love the colors but peels off ez on natural nails this set is really nice and works well for acrylic nails be warned that on natural nails the top coat burns when cured otherwise this product is awesome trash i love the base and top coat the only problem i have had is that the top coat came really lumpy but i have been working through it and just wiping the clumps off as i work but over all they are both great and last i love how it goes oni got so excited i ordered morebut it chips after a few daysam so very disappointed in thatwould not buy againnow that i already have bought it as a result of all them better tthan positive reviews i was not at all disappointed definitely recommended with no reservations long lasting but a few cons the product is very runny so you have to be careful otherwise you will have a lot of clean up around your cuticles to do before curing i did not have issues with peeling or chipping until a couple weeks later so that is a plus the biggest con for me was the removal i am not sure this is really soak off i soak cotton balls in 100 pure acetone and wrap in foil after 40 minutes only the top coat budged a little my gel polish another brand peeled off very easily but underneath the base coat was hard as a rock this is the same thing that happens when i use my regular gel polish top coat and forget that it has to filed off and accidentally soak them i love a good base and top coat but i do not want it to be so thick this product is much thicker than any i have used so far and i had a lot of bubbling on my nail and for these reasons i am passing on future purchases i have been using these for years seems like the formula changed lately less shiny does not have the same look under the led light not sure how it will hold up top coat was clumpy purchased 2 x happened to both top coats the top coat was not going on well i had to replace the top coat with a different brand but i still use the base coat the base coat works quite well difficult to remove it though but after 1 or 2 uses the top coat does not work very well at all it bubbles like crazy leaving a polka dot texture and my nails start chipping after 4 or 5 days of wear would not recommend functionally decent they smell atrocious though more so than any nail product i have smelled in my life acrylic smells better than this stuff it is like burning plastic straight from the bottle needs over 60 seconds under uv to set but that is not a huge deal i do not know what i have been doing wrong if anything but the base coat cures in a weird way it will almost bubble and shrink to one side of my nail i thought it was my technique or lamp but i later found out it was not the case the top coat is pretty solid though so i will keep using that i was so excited about finding a cheaper alternative to the sally hansen brand but the first time i stuck my hands in any water the top coat chipped right off and looked awful also took a long time to cure it is cheap but you should probably just pay a bit more for a better top coat nice gel as expected applies well dries well with my lamp is no wipe my only complaint is that it does not get thick or strong enough this product works for maybe a day or 2 but after that it peels off or chips easily so with that being said it definitely easy to remove lol would recommend just spending the money on a better product that might cost more you will save yourself time i have had these for some time now i do prefer this formula over other brands however after using for a while the outside of the bottles gets extremely sticky there is still plenty of polish left over in the bottle so i hate to throw it away but i might have to replace them because i cannot stand the feeling other than that everything is great just make sure that you keep them upright all the time and be careful when using this is amazing product love this product works great cures in 30secs would recommend 2 anyone who wants stronger lasting nails polish started chipping on day 1 to be fair it may have been the uv lamp i was using because i think it was defective hence the extra 2 stars i love that you do not have to wipe the topcoat but no matter how long i soak my nails the basecoat will not come off i have excellent soak off fingernail polish remover but the basecoat will not come off all of the way i am going to have to sand it off my nails wow this stuff lasts a very long time however it took me 3 separate times of soaking my nails with acetone to remove the top coat at 20 minutes each time i buffed my nails first to scratch it too it might be easier to let the polish grow out the top coat polish keeps its shine for entire time this stuff lasts a long timethe base coat did not even come off so i just buffed it off with my nail filei want to give this a great review the price is so good it is just so darn hard to remove i like the other polish colors but just will use my other brand base and top coats instead polish was awful it was thick and difficult to apply because it did not flow from the brushit globbed i did use the curing lightthinking it might kind of smooth out a bit and it took 45 mins supposed to take one minute to make it seem ok but it never did completely dry huge waste of my money and my time the top coat is amazing i love it the base coat is weird minus a star you have to put a super even coat on the whole nail and it cannot be too thin of a layer because it becomes uneven you have to use just the right amount anyway it makes me wonder if the base coat is even necessary also the base coat does not dry hard after the lamp it is a bit sticky so

Would definitely purchase again!, Not a good purchase, This camera works as advertised and video quality is more than I expected. Great features for the price. The adhesive in some of the mounts could be better. I wish they had special mount for ski helmets., This is a 12 megapixel camera with 4K video. Waterproof case is good and numerous attachments for mounts are included. Photo quality is less than average compared to my iPhone 6s and I can not get videos to play at all. Overall I would spend a few extra dollars and buy a better platform to capture life with., I bought this as a gift for my son, we haven't had a chance to use it just yet. The only issue I've had was inserting the SD memory card. Something seemed to be wrong with the slot. It wouldn't stay inserted all the way in, it seemed it was engaged like it already had a card in the slot. After some time I did manage to get it in correctly. We did do a practice video and took a picture, it has nice quality. We cant wait until the weather warms more to try it out., Bought this for my 9 year old son several months ago. It has been great. Glad we bought it. High quality for the reasonable price and a tough little camera.  It’s holding up well! No negatives I can think of. Works well with phone app. Glad I didn’t spend the extra money for GP. No need. This thing does it all. Lots of videos on YouTube comparing the two. See for yourself., Does not always stay on.I use it as a dash camera., The WIFI system sucks on this camera and the app it requires you to use keep crashing. I found another use for the camera but I would never by this camera again., I love this camera, works wonders for dirt bike trail riding and capturing sea life under water!, Product shipped fast, seems like a great camera so far just recently started using so not sure how to rate long term  yet., Audio doesn't pick up well in the protective case but the video is great. We're still learning to use it but the grandkids have fun recording things., I got this for my husband for a gift, the app didn't seem to work well with his Motorola phone, sinking issues and gave up on it. He has recently uodated to a new Samsung Galaxy 10, so hopefully will be able to get it to work w/it., Good price but takes terrible videos. It’s not worth the time to even save these videos. Look at the videos on the feedback, I don’t know why people think this is a good camera. Don’t waste your time., Very difficult to figure out what parts go to what and what they are used for. If you give them a good review they’ll give you another accessory that you’ll have no idea how to use. NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL INCLUDED. I guess you get what you pay for. I should have checked YouTube before purchasing this. Got it today, returning tomorrow., So far I'm impressed with this product. One things for sure no matter what u plan on mounting it to there's an accessory included to do so. I've only had it for a day but so far so good., doesn’t upload to your computer. Hard to work, This little cam is really good i went to the Bahamas last week and took many under water videos and photos and this camera work like a dream just remember to put in a high speed micro SD card (not included)., I absolutely love this and i have recommended it to all of my friends. I would definitely purchase this again. Thank you, No way that this is 12MP. No. Way! Also (and this was the main reason why I returned it)), the batteries lasted less than half an hour on a full charge. And, for some reason, the only way I could have turned on the camera was if I removed the battery from its compartment and re-insert it., Product works very well.  I use it for fishing and nature hikes. Taking videos hands free is a big advantage. I was impressed with all of the attachment accessories.Excellent value., While the picture is great, it appears that you have to set the date and time every time you change the battery. I haven't found anything in the manual that will save the date and time permanently which is unacceptable. Well I just found it #11. It says \"if you replace the battery, date and time will reset\". WT???????, Disappointing didn’t even work for 30mins in the water and stop working. Don’t waste your money!!!, UPDATED review:(SUPPORT to the Win) After seeing this review, the manufacturer emailed me back, and sent me 2 new batteries no charge, and both were timed by filming a clock, (lol) and both did about 2hrs of run time, of course i ran this once on each. Once summer comes i will pull out the helmet cam and go riding and push the camera to the limit. Advice, be sure to keep the camera outside of the waterpoof case if your riding in the heat, it gets hot with those batteries. Thanks Akaso for the follow upOriginal Review:I purchased this for my mtn bike rides and well it works nice but if you like having to try and time yourself on the trail and at 20 min per battery and only have 2 batteries than well, go for it, its a nice toy. Otherwise ya pay for what you get., The quality of the camera is about what you would expect for $60. It works exceptionally well in brightly lit areas like the outdoors and it also has a wide variety of attachments that make it great for whatever activity you plan on documenting such as hiking, water sports or skating.It's a great entry camera for people who are interested in getting involved with filmography., So I bought this item last year for a Xmas gift, and we are now just being able to use it. And the cord doesn't charge the battery, Works great for its price as well as wrist watch works with Simonides cameras as well great product great battery life, Lots of ways to use this camera. Ordered this thinking it would b great to b able to video our hunting dogs.  We were surprise at all the features it offered.  Must download the instructions and read carefully in order to get the best use from camera., Gave to grandchild.  Loves to show what he does., Wouldn't work for half my trip bought a memory card for it that was ment for the device, kept saying card in valid,battery's lasted about an 1hr, Have not had a chance to give a performance test of it. The box ship in was way to small for the item and it could have (lucky it did not) get damaged. So right now only can say packaging was not good. Will see later this week if camera is any good., It seems like a good camera. I have only used it in the pool so far.  I won't do scuba diving with it until June.The instructins are VERY lacking so it makes it much harder to figure out how to use.Also, I thought it had WAY to many extra parts that I will NEVER use., Very very, complicated. It will take a while to figure out., After opening the box and trying to figure it all out with no so hot directions and diagrams, I gave up and gave it to a friend's son who has more experience with the tech.  So many pieces and it was just not worth it for me.  I never even got it working so I can't judge the camera at all.  So, if you are into high tech camera stuff, it might be great, average user, not so much., It's not a bad unit if you're not willing to spend the money on the higher quality cameras. Bought it for hunting but it's hard to use in a pinch., No comparison to the GoPro.Not many features. No zooming capabilities. I guess you get what you pay for.Update: since posting the above I was contacted by Akaso and offered a partial refund which I received immediately once I agreed to it. Very good customer service., Camera shoots video really well for the price, however the app that goes with it is garbage, This is a good value camera we use for family events. Great price for an action cam, It's a solid camera pictures are ok. But, they look better on my phone. The batteries die pretty quick, I bought this as a second action cam to use for a different angle. The reviews I saw made it look impressive. My main camera is a Gopro Hero 4 so the video and audio quality just doesn't compare. If you were using 2 or 3 of these you could get by ok but this one just can't begin to keep up. It's kinda like a Volkswagen and a Ferrari having a race.One handy item with it that I didn't think I would use in the remote control. For videos, I just don't see much use but for snapping a picture it does \"ok\"., Not what I expected., Did not like that it was not compatible with my laptop or my android phone.  I needed a Mac computer or video editor to down load my videos., Fell off my motorcycle and broke and pieces first time out never got to use it, This product never worked. I took two videos and then it stopped turning on. Being the only camera I took on my trip to Egypt, I was very dissapointed., Takes amazing still shots at 60 fps while traveling at 55+ mph. Do not buy this if you are mounting it to anything that goes down the road. Instead spend a few dollars more and get the Brave 4 which is the upgrade to this model, which includes image stabilization. I can't report yet on how good that feature is on the other camera having bought it to replace this one. However, this one creates unwatchable video, at least mounted to a motorcycle. The image shudder is horrendous. You see some four different layers of the horizon jumbled together when playing back the video on the computer.  On this lower model the remote required the camera to be active for the two buttons to work. They do not turn the camera on. They don't stay lit as an indicator. On the back the lcd is nice, but to determine which mode is active, you have to look closely for the white camera icon to go red, when recording. When taking a snapshot, the screen flickers and resets to the camera, non recording mode. I used this flickering  indicator to know if the camera was recording, while looking through a tinted windshield where its mounted on the front of my bike.The upper model seems to have addressed some of these concerns, for the better. I'll have to review it once i get out on the bike and test it. There is yet another model that is even higher priced than the Brave 4, that one s You tuber claimed had real 4k and not digitally processed 4k like these two lower models, if that's a concern. I had no complaint with the still frame on this camera at speed, set to 60fps, even if it is not true 4k., This arrived with the plastic part that holds the camera to the handle broken.  It worked for the first couple of days, then the charging became iffy to the point where I had to hold the cable titled for it to charge. Then the next day the USB port fell inward into the unit and it could no longer charge.  The failure of the USB port after only a couple uses indicates that the manufacturing of this product is inferior. The camera was returned., Used it 4 times and now it doesn't work. I hope the added warranty is better than the camera., I bought this camera to help record a ski trip with my kids.  The biggest negative I have for it is that the camera is not waterproof.  I couldn't get any audio with the camera because it was stuck inside a waterproof case the whole time.  The worst part is the case got scratched on the lense so now I cant use the case and cant seem to find a replacement., DONT DO IT!!! My husband and I got this for our cruise and the SD card wouldn’t go in the camera. It’s like a piece was blocking it from going in so we couldn’t use it at all. Tried to get in contact and nothing. Spend the extra money for name brand of this is what off brand is like., I appreciate the quality of this product, Just received this yesterday. I have downloaded to apps in order to get videos. One says it download once you go to it you can only hear it. The other one let's you download it but can't share it anywhere because it's only the sound as well. You need a better app for people who only have phones to use. I'm going to try a couple more things but so far not really that great because of the app. If someone could let me know what they use for their phone that would be great. Thanks, Positive: product is cheap compare with others in the market. Image and video quality are okay.Negative: wifi features along with app connectivity are bad. Disconnects for no reason and is hard to manage. Sometime it will disconnect from the app but you couldn't work with it manually, unless you give it a hard reset (disconnect the battery). If you want better quality and connection I suggest you go with a GoPro., This item have been open before arriving to me . It box was without its brand new warranty seal, it is very shame why is happening it ? . It is lack of respect to the costumer;  please., Very poor quality overall. Picture, sound, stabilization are all not very good. After reading the other reviews that were positive, I don’t know if I even had the sam camera. Used it for a few hours and tried to be positive. After that, I returned it and got a Go Pro and I am so much happier., This camera came with so many amazing features and accessories! I love how great the underwater camera quality is and that it comes with two rechargeable batteries instead of constantly buying new batteries. It's super easy to use; my 4-year old can even operate it in the pool. Definitely recommend., My wife and I really liked it. For this price to be able to get a solid camera was really clutch! We went on a trip to DR and used it for a variety of adventures and I’m no camera guru at all. Can’t wait to try it for extreme uses., Used camera in and out of water works great the handle on camera needs to be longer to help stabilize the camera shot, Use this for my motorcycle. It does the job for cheap if you're looking for an action cam. 1 thing I would advise is to stock up on extra batteries. My daily commute is approximately 20 minutes and when I arrive, battery is near empty already. Maybe it's my settings(?) Not bad, just expecting a bit more., It works great! Sound is quiet if not connected to the iSmart dv app., Battery life last less than 90 minutes. Screen turns black when you are recording, so you can't see what you are filming. I wouldn't recommend it. I thought it was good at first but for longevity it isn't worth it. If you only plan to do 30 minutes between charges then it is right for you., I'm very happy with this camera. It comes with two rechargeable batteries, several mounts and a water-proof case for underwater footage., I picked this up for an up and coming trip as my primary camera failed after about 17 years (canon). I realize this isnt expected to perform on still photos as well as an SLR but i figured it would do as well as my cheap phone. It doesnt. Still photos are blurred no matter how they are taken. If you use them for thumbnails they are fine but if you plan to take stills of your trips do NOT use this as you will be very disappointed. The remote works. The \"water proof\" case is more like water resistant on the low end. Drop it in the tub its not going to protect your camera in my testing. Also the accessories everyone raves about. Almost all of them are useless outside buying more parts. They have a pamphlet that comes with the device you have to register to get the \"good stuff\". I refuse to do this because it means more spam. It borders on misleading. Anyhow, good low end, cheap and second camera ok for primary \"action\" video but nothing to write home about., good camera for price  def worth it just wish batterys lasted longer, OK here's my review I've loved the camera for since I purchased it and have taken many beautiful videos however, I just discovered that there's really no way of editing it I'm not sure why that is I expected it to be just as easy to edit it as a go pro but it's not.  So if you wanna just look at the videos that you shoot without editing  them it's a good camera takes great pictures but for me without the ability to edit it's basically worthless. I downloaded about 6 different editing software apps on my phone and none of them will recognize the video file.  It would be nice if the company that makes these cameras addressed this issue., - Price is awesome! Won't give me a heart-attack in case I lost it while having outdoor activities.- Camera is small and light enough to be attached to wrist- Camera is water-proof and operates well in water- Images and videos are stable and good quality for this price- It served us well in a recent rafting trip to Yellowstone and more ski trips in the winter., The camara stop recording for not reason and When it was recording you can not watch all the videos. Only a few. And the others video shows error, My son and I started using the AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports Action Camera Ultra HD Waterproof DV Camcorder 12MP 170 Degree Wide Angle yesterday and he had an absolute blast with it. Picture quality was great!  Unfortunately, as we were charging it this morning, the charging port pushed directly into the camera and was shaking around inside! We were able to unscrew the front of the camera and remove the charging port. It looks like it was only attached with two small tack welds. I emailed the company (through Amazon), but Amazon responded that there is an issue with the email address the company provided.  I didn't expect this camera to last forever, but I did expect the charging port to last more than 24 hours!, The camera has one of the worst picture and sound quality I've seen., Our gopro got water in it and ruined, so we wanted a replacement without spending so much money. This is the same size as a gopro...pretty good quality video. It came with 2 rechargeable batteries.  We also got the accessories which are a good cost and have so many options. If you do not want to spend a lot of money this is a great option for you!, It’s works great. My only problem with it is that I was recording a thing for my school and it would suddenly freeze and the only way to fix it was  to take out the battery. Apon further inspection, it would freeze whenever shaken too harshly., Finally got to use my camera on a scuba dive. But didn't really use it cause it leaked and is now not in my return window! Super disappointed!, This camera has ok image quality. It has a short battery life when recording, only about 1 hour. It does not come with a memory card.Rated 3 stars because of the short recording time/ battery life., Image quality for the money was good. Image stabilization not good. Good camera for the money, This camera ruined my motorcycle trip to morocco.  I was hopeing to get some footage of my motorcycle trip.  This camera would not work for me.  It continually froze and would become unresponsive after less than 5 minutes of operation., Nice little action cam for the price. Takes good video. Sound is not the best., Really really poor camera and sound quality. Waste of money to be honest. Bought to record vacation memories and aircraft takeoffs and landings. The sound quality is the worst., The video quality is just ok. This is a case where you see 4K and think its gonna be great, then you get it and its just OK., It is a small camera and I like that. I can take it with me wherever I go if I need it. I like the battery. And is easy to take pictures and video but I don't like too much the picture quality and color balance. All depends how you want to use it., Unfortunately I haven't been able to use this camera but twice. The battery says charged but when I unplug from the power source it shuts off. The buttons are confusing. Manual was no help. I was really excited to get and use this camera for my horse back riding but guess I will look for something else., This is a great alternative to trendy GoPro cameras. It has all the features the kids are looking for for sport videos and more., Good amount of accessories and quality seems as good as the GoPro., Not a bad camera just not was i was expecting. Having a GoPro this doesn’t really compare., After 3 weeks it stopped working.  I returned it for a full refund and got myself a GoPro Hero 5.  It is working well, and longer than this camera.  I would have kept it, had it continued to work., I actually bought 2. I'm changing my original 4 stars to just 2. The quality of the videos I shot and downloaded are very poor. Not the quality of my work! But from the camera. From both cameras. When I first noticed I went and shot with the other camera. Same thing! It's very disappointing., You get what you pay for.... video is extremely jumpy. Picture doesn’t even seem to be 720p., If you want to record your bike rides, this camera is NOT a good choice. It doesn’t have any image stabilization., Image is not clear, not 4K, This camera is easy to use and takes really good clear pictures. I've used this during hunts and for other random things. Great camera., Before I could use it for the third time. The clip that holds the buttons in place. The one for the power. Came off!! No it's useless under water or in salt air conditions!! Not happy at all!!! It was a week old at best!!, A little shakey when running but overall it's a nice camera for the price, Great videos, but the battery life is goes quickly., The battery didn't last very long - a couple hours at most.  The plus side is the camera comes with two rechargeable batteries so I was able to replace it when it died.  Video quality was good, picture quality left much to be desired.  I could've taken better pictures on my phone.  Sound is almost non-existent when in the water proof case.  It comes with many accessories that I couldn't figure out and the manual was no help.  Tons of accessories but not one selfie stick which is really what we wanted.  I bought this for a trip to Kauai and it served its purpose.  If you're looking for an affordable option for a vacation I recommend buying this camera.  If you're looking to get more usage than one trip, I'd recommend investing in a better camera., Great Color. But battery only lasts about 30 minutes., Quality seems very solid, has gone on a few kayaking trips so far and the waterproofing is up to the job.  Video quality is really good although I'll admit I haven't spent any time testing its limits as far as fast action or low light conditions.  I'll probably buy a few more, I have a Gen 1 Gopro Hero and this easily meets the same quality plus more features., Just check the video for yourself! This is a recording of the Audio/Video Sync Test available on YouTube that I recorded just minutes ago. I have emailed Akaso support. I'll provide an update once I hear back., The charging port no longer works, seems the fins in the actual port bent over?, Great value on the dollar., Got this for a trip to the USVI and got some great moments with it, This does not include a needed micro card., I purchased this item thinking it would be a bargain deal that's comparable to GoPro. They're incomparable and I wished I would've spent a little extra for a much better quality GoPro., Like how portable it is yet provides great quality videos, Great for the price. However, it only takes good video and pictures in high light. Low light settings look terrible. Definitely not 1080 p., Video quality is very poor. Cannot be use for anything proper. Phone take a better video, Just bought this for my daughter’s birthday. She will be using this on our vacation this summer!, I bought this camera as a good alternative to the name brand rival that is 5 times the cost, figured what do I have to lose, it’s only $75. I was actually pleasantly suprised that the video quality above and under water is really good. Then I downloaded the software from the app store and was wondering why it has so many bad reviews and barely a 2 star rating. After installing it I attempted to transfer some of my videos from the camera to my phone and the app would crash on any video that is longer then 1 minute in length. Also the downloaded videos remain with in the app and can’t be saved to your stream. In conclusion the iphone app is very poor quality and if you don’t mind removing the SD card to copy the video to your computer then this camera is a good buy, otherwise if you want to use the app on your phone and to transfer the video footage to your phone over wifi I would not recommend this camera or this brand, Image quality and stabilization is bad. Returning the product., Doesn't work properly as expected some time it turns on some time it doesn't battery were fully charge this item sucks, Really easy set up, Works Great!, I used it in my car to capture the back roads and the battery life is a lot shorter than another action camera.  Used it once ride and returned it just because of battery life., Nice action cam but they could do better no stabilization at all, No instructions included but did come with a good bit of attachments, It’s okay... I bought a memory card. When I video the screen blacks out after a min. There were bubbles on the screen when I opened it., I liked the camera and had good picture., Unfortunately the cover of my battery broke and now I can’t used, I wish they would include in the description somewhere that this camera does NOT include audio! Only photo/video. Waste of money for me.</td>\n",
       "      <td>i was not impressed with the image quality also the app that was suggested to use my phone as a remote for it did not work properly biggest pain to attach to a helmet but works well otherwise the only thing about the camera was that i had no clue it was so small we enjoy using this camera to get a canine view of our dogs activities it fits well into their harness and we get to see them running swimming and playing there are a large number of function and features so reading the instructions is a must especially to take full advantage of the power of this camera it holds up well to use we have had no problems with it in several months would definitely purchase again not a good purchase this camera works as advertised and video quality is more than i expected great

closely for the white camera icon to go red when recording when taking a snapshot the screen flickers and resets to the camera non recording mode i used this flickering indicator to know if the camera was recording while looking through a tinted windshield where its mounted on the front of my bikethe upper model seems to have addressed some of these concerns for the better i will have to review it once i get out on the bike and test it there is yet another model that is even higher priced than the brave 4 that one s you tuber claimed had real 4k and not digitally processed 4k like these two lower models if that is a concern i had no complaint with the still frame on this camera at speed set to 60fps even if it is not true 4k this arrived with the plastic part that holds the camera to the handle broken it worked for the first couple of days then the charging became iffy to the point where i had to hold the cable titled for it to charge then the next day the usb port fell inward into the unit and it could no longer charge the failure of the usb port after only a couple uses indicates that the manufacturing of this product is inferior the camera was returned used it 4 times and now it does not work i hope the added warranty is better than the camera i bought this camera to help record a ski trip with my kids the biggest negative i have for it is that the camera is not waterproof i could not get any audio with the camera because it was stuck inside a waterproof case the whole time the worst part is the case got scratched on the lense so now i cannot use the case and cannot seem to find a replacement do not do it my husband and i got this for our cruise and the sd card would not go in the camera it is like a piece was blocking it from going in so we could not use it at all tried to get in contact and nothing spend the extra money for name brand of this is what off brand is like i appreciate the quality of this product just received this yesterday i have downloaded to apps in order to get videos one says it download once you go to it you can only hear it the other one let us you download it but cannot share it anywhere because it is only the sound as well you need a better app for people who only have phones to use i am going to try a couple more things but so far not really that great because of the app if someone could let me know what they use for their phone that would be great thanks positive product is cheap compare with others in the market image and video quality are okaynegative wifi features along with app connectivity are bad disconnects for no reason and is hard to manage sometime it will disconnect from the app but you could not work with it manually unless you give it a hard reset disconnect the battery if you want better quality and connection i suggest you go with a gopro this item have been open before arriving to me it box was without its brand new warranty seal it is very shame why is happening it it is lack of respect to the costumer please very poor quality overall picture sound stabilization are all not very good after reading the other reviews that were positive i do not know if i even had the sam camera used it for a few hours and tried to be positive after that i returned it and got a go pro and i am so much happier this camera came with so many amazing features and accessories i love how great the underwater camera quality is and that it comes with two rechargeable batteries instead of constantly buying new batteries it is super easy to use my 4year old can even operate it in the pool definitely recommend my wife and i really liked it for this price to be able to get a solid camera was really clutch we went on a trip to dr and used it for a variety of adventures and i am no camera guru at all cannot wait to try it for extreme uses used camera in and out of water works great the handle on camera needs to be longer to help stabilize the camera shot use this for my motorcycle it does the job for cheap if you are looking for an action cam 1 thing i would advise is to stock up on extra batteries my daily commute is approximately 20 minutes and when i arrive battery is near empty already maybe it is my settings not bad just expecting a bit more it works great sound is quiet if not connected to the ismart dv app battery life last less than 90 minutes screen turns black when you are recording so you cannot see what you are filming i would not recommend it i thought it was good at first but for longevity it is not worth it if you only plan to do 30 minutes between charges then it is right for you i am very happy with this camera it comes with two rechargeable batteries several mounts and a waterproof case for underwater footage i picked this up for an up and coming trip as my primary camera failed after about 17 years canon i realize this is not expected to perform on still photos as well as an slr but i figured it would do as well as my cheap phone it does not still photos are blurred no matter how they are taken if you use them for thumbnails they are fine but if you plan to take stills of your trips do not use this as you will be very disappointed the remote works the water proof case is more like water resistant on the low end drop it in the tub its not going to protect your camera in my testing also the accessories everyone raves about almost all of them are useless outside buying more parts they have a pamphlet that comes with the device you have to register to get the good stuff i refuse to do this because it means more spam it borders on misleading anyhow good low end cheap and second camera ok for primary action video but nothing to write home about good camera for price def worth it just wish batterys lasted longer ok here is my review i have loved the camera for since i purchased it and have taken many beautiful videos however i just discovered that there is really no way of editing it i am not sure why that is i expected it to be just as easy to edit it as a go pro but it is not so if you want to just look at the videos that you shoot without editing them it is a good camera takes great pictures but for me without the ability to edit it is basically worthless i downloaded about 6 different editing software apps on my phone and none of them will recognize the video file it would be nice if the company that makes these cameras addressed this issue price is awesome will not give me a heartattack in case i lost it while having outdoor activities camera is small and light enough to be attached to wrist camera is waterproof and operates well in water images and videos are stable and good quality for this price it served us well in a recent rafting trip to yellowstone and more ski trips in the winter the camara stop recording for not reason and when it was recording you can not watch all the videos only a few and the others video shows error my son and i started using the akaso ek7000 4k wifi sports action camera ultra hd waterproof dv camcorder 12mp 170 degree wide angle yesterday and he had an absolute blast with it picture quality was great unfortunately as we were charging it this morning the charging port pushed directly into the camera and was shaking around inside we were able to unscrew the front of the camera and remove the charging port it looks like it was only attached with two small tack welds i emailed the company through amazon but amazon responded that there is an issue with the email address the company provided i did not expect this camera to last forever but i did expect the charging port to last more than 24 hours the camera has one of the worst picture and sound quality i have seen our gopro got water in it and ruined so we wanted a replacement without spending so much money this is the same size as a gopropretty good quality video it came with 2 rechargeable batteries we also got the accessories which are a good cost and have so many options if you do not want to spend a lot of money this is a great option for you it is works great my only problem with it is that i was recording a thing for my school and it would suddenly freeze and the only way to fix it was to take out the battery apon further inspection it would freeze whenever shaken too harshly finally got to use my camera on a scuba dive but did not really use it because it leaked and is now not in my return window super disappointed this camera has ok image quality it has a short battery life when recording only about 1 hour it does not come with a memory cardrated 3 stars because of the short recording time battery life image quality for the money was good image stabilization not good good camera for the money this camera ruined my motorcycle trip to morocco i was hopeing to get some footage of my motorcycle trip this camera would not work for me it continually froze and would become unresponsive after less than 5 minutes of operation nice little action cam for the price takes good video sound is not the best really really poor camera and sound quality waste of money to be honest bought to record vacation memories and aircraft takeoffs and landings the sound quality is the worst the video quality is just ok this is a case where you see 4k and think its going to be great then you get it and its just ok it is a small camera and i like that i can take it with me wherever i go if i need it i like the battery and is easy to take pictures and video but i do not like too much the picture quality and color balance all depends how you want to use it unfortunately i have not been able to use this camera but twice the battery says charged but when i unplug from the power source it shuts off the buttons are confusing manual was no help i was really excited to get and use this camera for my horse back riding but guess i will look for something else this is a great alternative to trendy gopro cameras it has all the features the kids are looking for for sport videos and more good amount of accessories and quality seems as good as the gopro not a bad camera just not was i was expecting having a gopro this does not really compare after 3 weeks it stopped working i returned it for a full refund and got myself a gopro hero 5 it is working well and longer than this camera i would have kept it had it continued to work i actually bought 2 i am changing my original 4 stars to just 2 the quality of the videos i shot and downloaded are very poor not the quality of my work but from the camera from both cameras when i first noticed i went and shot with the other camera same thing it is very disappointing you get what you pay for video is extremely jumpy picture does not even seem to be 720p if you want to record your bike rides this camera is not a good choice it does not have any image stabilization image is not clear not 4k this camera is easy to use and takes really good clear pictures i have used this during hunts and for other random things great camera before i could use it for the third time the clip that holds the buttons in place the one for the power came off no it is useless under water or in salt air conditions not happy at all it was a week old at best a little shakey when running but overall it is a nice camera for the price great videos but the battery life is goes quickly the battery did not last very long a couple hours at most the plus side is the camera comes with two rechargeable batteries so i was able to replace it when it died video quality was good picture quality left much to be desired i could have taken better pictures on my phone sound is almost nonexistent when in the water proof case it comes with many accessories that i could not figure out and the manual was no help tons of accessories but not one selfie stick which is really what we wanted i bought this for a trip to kauai and it served its purpose if you are looking for an affordable option for a vacation i recommend buying this camera if you are looking to get more usage than one trip i would recommend investing in a better camera great color but battery only lasts about 30 minutes quality seems very solid has gone on a few kayaking trips so far and the waterproofing is up to the job video quality is really good although i will admit i have not spent any time testing its limits as far as fast action or low light conditions i will probably buy a few more i have a gen 1 gopro hero and this easily meets the same quality plus more features just check the video for yourself this is a recording of the audiovideo sync test available on youtube that i recorded just minutes ago i have emailed akaso support i will provide an update once i hear back the charging port no longer works seems the fins in the actual port bent over great value on the dollar got this for a trip to the usvi and got some great moments with it this does not include a needed micro card i purchased this item thinking it would be a bargain deal that is comparable to gopro they are incomparable and i wished i would have spent a little extra for a much better quality gopro like how portable it is yet provides great quality videos great for the price however it only takes good video and pictures in high light low light settings look terrible definitely not 1080 p video quality is very poor cannot be use for anything proper phone take a better video just bought this for my daughters birthday she will be using this on our vacation this summer i bought this camera as a good alternative to the name brand rival that is 5 times the cost figured what do i have to lose it is only 75 i was actually pleasantly suprised that the video quality above and under water is really good then i downloaded the software from the app store and was wondering why it has so many bad reviews and barely a 2 star rating after installing it i attempted to transfer some of my videos from the camera to my phone and the app would crash on any video that is longer then 1 minute in length also the downloaded videos remain with in the app and cannot be saved to your stream in conclusion the iphone app is very poor quality and if you do not mind removing the sd card to copy the video to your computer then this camera is a good buy otherwise if you want to use the app on your phone and to transfer the video footage to your phone over wifi i would not recommend this camera or this brand image quality and stabilization is bad returning the product does not work properly as expected some time it turns on some time it does not battery were fully charge this item sucks really easy set up works great i used it in my car to capture the back roads and the battery life is a lot shorter than another action camera used it once ride and returned it just because of battery life nice action cam but they could do better no stabilization at all no instructions included but did come with a good bit of attachments it is okay i bought a memory card when i video the screen blacks out after a min there were bubbles on the screen when i opened it i liked the camera and had good picture unfortunately the cover of my battery broke and now i cannot used i wish they would include in the description somewhere that this camera does not include audio only photovideo waste of money for me</td>\n",

       "      <td>The laptop arrived just in time for school!! Works great., Product description very much lied about the keyboard being backlit. Pretty pissed about that considering it the reason I chose this laptop over others I was looking at. Otherwise, it works fine for the basic little wprd processor I use it for. Also, not a cool design like any online description of the model. This one is straight flat black. Incredibly plain-looking. And one of my keys is at a wonky angle, but it works. Considering the ither asus products I own, this one falls short, honestly.If you want to take it out of S Mode, go to activation and choose to change your edition to regular Windows Home. Its a free switch., Works good.But the keyboard is not backlit.Good buy, if you don't need a backlit keyboard., I love how light weight and compact it is. And the numeric pad as well. So far I’m pretty happy and content with it., I ordered this small laptop for work purposes and general office operations.  So far, it's been well worth the money.  I took it out of Windows S mode.  It struggled (lagged) a bit with Chrome, so I resorted to using the Microsoft Internet browser but it's been fine.  And since I only use it for work (general office stuff), it's done everything that I could have asked....thus far!, The number dial is pretty accurate. Sleek design and very lightweight. Perfect product for the average commuter, If you feel that you need the trifling advantage of the \"easy access\" NumberPad, go ahead and buy this one. If you don't, avoid this one--it's a constant annoyance. Think you can permanently disable the NumberPad? Good luck with that., Amazing product it’s small do you can easily carry it around with no extra weight, For 190 bucks, this is perfect. I think tablets are very overrated.  I only like touchscreens on a phone.  This computer is the size of a tablet, incredibly light.  I just wanted something to do my financial stuff, email, shop and casually browse the internet.  I don't watch movies on my computer but it plays you tube type videos just fine.  sound is a little weak but if I want to listen to music I can cast it to my stereo.  What I like best is the size and weight. Small and light. And it seems to be built solid. I charge it at night and use it off and on all day and there is plenty of juice left. I could probably charge it every other night if I wanted.  I've only had it a couple weeks but I feel very good about my purchase., Screen was good but touch screen sucked...the lol mouse would disappear from screen and just pop up anywhere and wouldnt click on items the 1st click(it takes multiple clicks to get to where I'm trying to go)., It is perfect for my personal use and easy to navigate. Light weight and fits into my bag to carry with me., I like the size and for the price it’s worth buying., small, compact and convenient, Stay away from Windows 10 S ! Let me tell you what it is ..... trash 🗑!!!!!!! You can’t download anything from browser unless is from their crappy App Store! I couldn’t download Sketchup ! This is the worst part you CANT use GOOGLE!!! Like what the F ! They only allow you to use Bing ,who in the right mind uses that search engine!! No oneeee! You have to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to Windows 10 pro to be able to use your brand new computer like a normal person would like to do! Very very disappointed with this stupid “windows 10s” upgrade! (Not even an upgrade)!!!!! Please do your self a favor and buy a Mac !, My wife bought this for email and Facebook essentially. I had to uninstall the Windows 10S features because it kept freezing on the screen that said only approved windows 10 S apps would work.This warning came up randomly even though the only apps on the laptop WERE from the Microsoft App store.Finally I said ok no more Windows 10S and dropped it in favor of plain Windows 10. Since that time there has been no problem and no discernible detriment to the function. It is very small so be advised if this is a concern., ********************************** 07/24/2021 **********************************being firmilier with windows seizing possession of computers overclocking chip-sets and burning them out first on my listidisabled secure boot and set the supervisor password in bios so windows andits automatic this and automatic that could not inflict further damage to thehardware without firstly obtaining my express permissionnot trusting windows and its most advanced network hacking teqnikesi then proceeded to install my 9 GB linux clone in 10 minutes flathowever i needed windows to register this new computer sos i started windowsafter setup finished without a internet connection it said theres nointernet conection try this troubleshooterwhich arived at the decision that i needed to reset the router (NOT TRUE)  duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhbut why win 10 was updating at chip sizlun full throttle thats the true reason  out of pure curiosity i let this rogue os update it took a full day and a halfbefore i could use edge browser to register in my asusand by the way my last laptop used to do the same thing everytime itupdated until i**************************************************************** disabled the automatic updates  ** by setting the ipv4 gateway address to a bad address ** and unchecking ipv6 protocal  ** in the network configuration dialogue  ****************************************************************2 words braught the micysoft madness to a sqeeky halt********  GRUB-INSTALL *********the wifi chip is a realtekRTL8821CE---the cpu temp is a cool 100 degree farenhite after waking from a nap---and under your control linux will run your chipset at 108 degrees farenheightat idle with bluetooth radio on---in linuxvbox windows 98 running the yamaha SYXG50 soft synthysizer which by the wayrenders the dsp effects in software on 12 miditracks laden with yamaha sysex register 20% cpu utilizationand 117 degree farenheit cpu temp and play hifi music without hickupthis vm cuts the battery life to about 9 hours---also the battery has about 19 hours of secure browsing in it using 2048 bitencryption over bluetooth connect---intense usage such as simultaniuos remote desktop and ssl secure browsing bringtemp to even 120 degree and battery life is 1 hour per 10 percent battery capacity---running linux headless and radio off give you &gt; 40 hours of batteryapache2 server + file sharing + encrypted ssh is on---in linuxthe 14 inch keyboard is backlighted up for your pleasure and for due reasonit is almost impossible to see your key in anything but direct sunlighthowever this is a much needed feature regaurdless  A very usefull feature on the extended keyboard is the well placed home and end keyit follows the standard template for laptops except there is one more row on the far rightwhich has the following keyspower buttonhomepage uppage downendFN*******************************************************************************linux xcfe desktop uses about 1.1 gig of memory out of the installed 4 Gigwith 6 virtual desktops and 5 different apps running*******************************************************************************the charging cord is 6 foot loong and she charges up from 50% to 99% in &gt; a hour*******************************************************************************the integrated video tops out at 1920x1080 and bottoms out at 320x180and refresh rates vary from 60 hz to 120 hzthe battery life sinks exponentialy with increased resolution and refresh rates, I just wanted something simple to use for files and meetings. However, the webcam is awful. The image is poor quality and if you move at all you will be one big blur, so I will need to buy a separate webcam to use. The key clicks are loud as you type, and although the number pad on the mouse pad is a nifty option, it will come on and off when you don't intend it to. Overall, not bad for the price, but the high rating seems to be misleading. Not sure how much I trust Amazon reviews at this point, I saw no mention of the poor quality webcam and that was one thing I noticed right off the bat considering how prevalent Zoom is nowadays., Worked great out of the box but would not turn on the next day.  Shame as it was perfect for my needs., Quit working after a week, It has M.2 which supports NVMe SSD.soldered RAM, works pretty fine to me. I buy it for my daughter and it have all thing that she needs., Perhaps I goofed or something, but even a live boot wouldn't take., It is not user friendly., Well worth the price. Small long battery life. Enough capability to support remote learning, Cheap Chinese garbage, So far the L210 slim laptop is good for working on projects and would make a great investment for a highschool or college grade laptop. Had to make a couple adjustments like uninstall the graphics driver and install the intel one because graphics problems with chrome as well as in chrome disable the \"use hardware acceleration when available\" setting because of graphics errors caused. the other adjustment made was creating my own power plan because with the one that comes pre-made for it doesnt do the laptop much justice. basic power plan was 4-6 hours on battery but with a well setup plan have it setup it can do 6-10 hours with videos and 10-12 hours on everything else from browsing web to having multiple programs running. some stuff you should know is the graphics is 2gb which can handle 1080 videos easy depending on your internet speed. 4gb of ram and barely any is actually used unless you have alot of programs running at once. the processor says 1.2ghz dual core but the speeds that have been running are  1.8-4ghz so far depending on whats running. doesnt get too hot when running games or videos so wont get burns when sitting a your lap. 1 thing tho is that it is listed as having a backlit keyboard but it does not have one. After dealing with windows updates and driver updates theres around 20-25 gb left of space available so if you decide to buy one of these laptops make sure to get a micro sd card for it so you can expand the space and i recommend 120-500 gig., Works good, fast, light weight., Outside of the mouse pad \" I like it a lot.\", It's been more than a month since I got mine and about 3 weeks in the touch pad stopped working. Trying getting it fixed by a technician who wants an arm and a leg to fix it. I'm not a fan of using a mouse so disappointment is an understatement at this stage., Remember you get what you pay for. Very slow but for paying bills and very light gaming it is serviceable., Initially I thought I'd gotten one of those rare deals ... something fairly good for a lower price.  I was being optimistic.1.  Screen saver doesn't work2.  When in \"sleep\", you can't always get the computer to wake up - you have to reboot3.  Applications lock randomly - Chrome, Excel etc - initially thought it happened after the laptop had been idle for awhile - but it happens randomly at any time, even when in use.  Some or all app's become locked/unresponsive and you have to close/restart them4. This is more a personal gripe - the sound quality is very poor.  But again, it's a low end computer so it really should be expected - I just didn't expect the sound to be this bad.On the plus side -1.  It is fairly fast and boots quickly, The picture description says BACK-LIT KEYBOARD, but it isn't! Whomever designed the website for ASUS should be fired! I went through a big hassle trying to find an ASUS laptop that actually had the back-lit keyboard that was advertised on several of their models, but didn't have it! I wound up buying an ASUS 14\" laptop that actually had the ADVERTISED back-lit keyboard from Office Depot/Office Max. I had them verify it before I bought it., USPS delivered this today. Big box with a fairly big box (and padding) in it with a small and light laptop in that. I had it unpacked and charging in no time.Since I never intended to ever use the WIN10 installed on it (or even boot it) it took a bit to figure out how to get into the computer settings so that I could boot from a USB drive that I had Linux Mint installer loaded on.A WORD OF CAUTION for those that are going to install Linux - the current popular install .ISO's don't have the drivers for the WIFI chip! The drivers will have to be installed manually. Bluetooth does however work and I was easily able to link this computer to my iPhone and get out to the internet that way.WORK A ROUND: I ordered a cheap (~$20) \"TP Link\" USB 802.11N (only 2.5Ghz) Wifi adapter, plugged it in and it just works. Maybe someday Linux will have drivers for the built in WiFi chip in this device.While the only CPU'S that Intel makes that are crapper than a Celeron is a Atom I found this on the web:\"The Intel Celeron N4020 is one of the most budget-friendly and power-efficient laptop processors. ... As for gaming, the Intel UHD 600 graphics of the Celeron N4020 is one of the weakest solutions. It can be used only for the lightest games.\"To sum up the above, it is a very cheap and uses very little power.For its size, the keyboard and screen are ok. The keys have good travel. It has a matte screen.This is a small and very light computer. It is 'snappy' enough surfing the web and running Linux native applications. While I'm not clear on this but it appears that it can be charged with a standard USB-C charger.I'll have to take it out in the wild to see how the battery life holds up on it. Running Linux the battery should last as least as long (or longer!) than it does while running WIN10., I bought this laptop to use for leisure travel this next year.  Wanted something bigger and more useful than the tablet I currently have.  While I have just started the setup process, ie loading my apps, files, etc., it is doing exactly what I wanted it to do.  I've switched to Windows Home, installed all my apps and it's currently updating Windows.  It is showing lots of promise!, This was a MAJOR selling feature for me since I work nights. Description needs updated., It's fine otherwise, but the trac pad stopped working a few days after we started using it., Recieved yesterday.Still reading info on using micro soft...... I'm use to Google use but this lap top has much more to offer IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET USE TO IT.., Purchased this laptop in March 2021 and it only lasted six months with light use. One day I could no longer connect to the internet. Ran the troubleshooter and it said it could not find a network adapter. Tried everything suggested, but still can't connect to the internet. Total waste of money!, I am giving this tablet two stars as it is inexpensive (under $200) and lightweight, other than that I would give it one star.  I should have read the description more carefully as it is not a touchscreen model.  Get your fingers to work on the touchpad if hard enough but the way this was designed if you aren't very careful you are constantly turning on the numbering feature.  It is a serious stupid design.  You have all the number above the alpha keys. Grab a calculator if you need it.  I waited too long on return it., Excellent for just information support for your job, 365 micro soft is useless, For the price you can’t complain it works for basic usage as browsing the Internet. I would recommend for anyone who needs a laptop with basic functionality ., Easy to use, up in a second.  I love it.  Then I realized that I couldn't hear a damn thing.  I'm on a computer 12 hours a day, I know how to work them.  I adjusted the controls...blah blah.  Could barely hear the volume on some things, particularly YOUTUBE.  Finally looked and lo and behold, the speaker are on the bottom. How in the hell can speakers project when you have the danged thing in your lap?  My thighs completely block all sound.  So in order to hear certain things, I have to hold it up to my face.  Yes, I've trouble shooted everything. Yes, I know what I'm doing, and Yes, I'm sending it back.  SOUND SUCKS and I don't want to have a little speaker attached to the top so I can hear., Perfect for what it has been designed for: internet browsing, music, playing videos. can play Terraria, Arrived without windows bootingUpon boot enter BIOS and I get “no bootable device”. You can tell the manual has been beat up. When filling in return on Amazon I find support phone number but despite being advertised as open nobody answers., I dislike the confusion with it's programs. Not one to be a \"refresher\" on..after so many years!I feel I made a mistake with choosing this.., Laptop is smaller but has everything you need for school and very light so easy to travel with overall good computer for price, Sound stopped working completely after a week, It won't turn on after having it led than 30 days, What I expected, It’s cute, and quiet, but the screen is made in a way that you HAVE to look at it at a certain angle or it feels weird on your eyes and only the center circle is bright while the edges appear dark.  I’ve never hated a laptop screen so much. It’s almost like it has a privacy screen on it., Well it really wasn't what I was looking for. It's kinda slow, and I really couldn't get too many good apps on it. And it seems much smaller than what it's size is supposed to be., I wanted this laptop to do only one thing - act as the control for a label printer, but it couldn't even do that. It took forever to boot, and everyday tasks kept crashing it. Totally useless! I returned it as soon as I could get it to shutdown., This computer was a great purchase for my son. He likes to play Roblox, Minecraft and Steam games. This computer has the capability and speed to play these games and plenty of room to hold them. It is not a gaming computer but is capable of playing these games without too much lag time. The touchpad that moves the mouse icon does like to stop responding to touch but simply press the F6 key to toggle it back on and off and it will start working or plug in a mouse. The battery lasts an extremely long amount of time. The display is very clear and good quality. Excellent product for the price. The seller, Lucky Trading, has excellent customer service and was very helpful with communication and when I needed product support. Highly recommended., I only needed the computer for zoom.  Whenever I touched the mic I had to hit it several times to turn on mic to speak.  It was a pain so I returned the computer.  I prefer touch screen &amp; a larger screen., It took about ten minutes to download Google Chrome, and when it did, simply opening a new tab on the app took at least two minutes for it to fully load. I bought this laptop to use for writing and schoolwork, but the speed was just unbearable., Much smaller than I imagine but was ok. Easy to carry around, fast enough for my use., Dislike nothing! I use it for work  l like that it was easy to use, It's a laptop and it does laptop things. If you need it to do heavy intensive things, it might not do the things.But if you keep your expectations low, you'll probably not be disappointed., The size and range of motion is pretty coolEdit: the family safety automatically being turned on is irritating. The dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. I’ve taken some mins to set the computer up I don’t want to spend more time, Screen might put some people off. Battery is phenomenal, it’s silent, and the audio is fine. Perfect for on the go.</td>\n",

and compact it is and the numeric pad as well so far i am pretty happy and content with it i ordered this small laptop for work purposes and general office operations so far it is been well worth the money i took it out of windows s mode it struggled lagged a bit with chrome so i resorted to using the microsoft internet browser but it is been fine and since i only use it for work general office stuff it is done everything that i could have askedthus far the number dial is pretty accurate sleek design and very lightweight perfect product for the average commuter if you feel that you need the trifling advantage of the easy access numberpad go ahead and buy this one if you do not avoid this oneit is a constant annoyance think you can permanently disable the numberpad good luck with that amazing product it is small do you can easily carry it around with no extra weight for 190 bucks this is perfect i think tablets are very overrated i only like touchscreens on a phone this computer is the size of a tablet incredibly light i just wanted something to do my financial stuff email shop and casually browse the internet i do not watch movies on my computer but it plays you tube type videos just fine sound is a little weak but if i want to listen to music i can cast it to my stereo what i like best is the size and weight small and light and it seems to be built solid i charge it at night and use it off and on all day and there is plenty of juice left i could probably charge it every other night if i wanted i have only had it a couple weeks but i feel very good about my purchase screen was good but touch screen suckedthe lol mouse would disappear from screen and just pop up anywhere and would not click on items the 1st clickit takes multiple clicks to get to where i am trying to go it is perfect for my personal use and easy to navigate light weight and fits into my bag to carry with me i like the size and for the price it is worth buying small compact and convenient stay away from windows 10 s let me tell you what it is trash you cannot download anything from browser unless is from their crappy app store i could not download sketchup this is the worst part you cannot use google like what the f they only allow you to use bing who in the right mind uses that search engine no oneeee you have to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to windows 10 pro to be able to use your brand new computer like a normal person would like to do very very disappointed with this stupid windows 10s upgrade not even an upgrade please do your self a favor and buy a mac my wife bought this for email and facebook essentially i had to uninstall the windows 10s features because it kept freezing on the screen that said only approved windows 10 s apps would workthis warning came up randomly even though the only apps on the laptop were from the microsoft app storefinally i said ok no more windows 10s and dropped it in favor of plain windows 10 since that time there has been no

sure how much i trust amazon reviews at this point i saw no mention of the poor quality webcam and that was one thing i noticed right off the bat considering how prevalent zoom is nowadays worked great out of the box but would not turn on the next day shame as it was perfect for my needs quit working after a week it has m2 which supports nvme ssdsoldered ram works pretty fine to me i buy it

capability to support remote learning cheap chinese garbage so far the l210 slim laptop is good for working on projects and would make a great investment for a highschool or college grade laptop had to make a couple adjustments like uninstall the graphics driver and install the intel one because graphics problems with chrome as well as in chrome disable the use hardware acceleration when available setting because of graphics errors caused the other adjustment made was creating my own power plan because with the one that comes premade for it does not do the laptop much justice basic power plan was 46 hours on battery but with a well setup plan have it setup it can do 610 hours with videos and 1012 hours on everything else from browsing web to having multiple programs running some stuff you should know is the graphics is 2gb which can handle 1080 videos easy depending on your internet speed 4gb of ram and barely any is actually used unless you have alot of programs running at once the processor says 12ghz dual core but the speeds that have been running are 184ghz so far depending on what is running does not get too hot when running games or videos so will not get burns when sitting a your lap 1 thing though is that it is listed as having a backlit keyboard but it does not have one after dealing with windows updates and driver updates there is around 2025 gb left of space available so if you decide to buy one of these laptops make sure to get a micro sd card for it so you can expand the space and i recommend 120500 gig works good fast light weight outside of the mouse pad i like it a lot it is been more than a month since i got mine and about 3 weeks in the touch pad stopped working trying getting it fixed by a technician who wants an arm and a leg to fix it i am not a fan of using a mouse so disappointment is an understatement at this stage remember you get what you pay for very slow but for paying bills and very light gaming it is serviceable initially i thought i would gotten one of those rare deals something fairly good for a lower price i was being optimistic1 screen saver does not work2 when in sleep you cannot always get the computer to wake up you have to reboot3 applications lock randomly chrome excel etc initially thought it happened after the laptop had been idle for awhile but it happens randomly at any time even when in use some or all apps become lockedunresponsive and you have to closerestart them4 this is more a personal gripe the sound quality is very poor but again it is a low end computer so it really should be expected i just did not expect the sound to be this badon the plus side 1 it is fairly fast and boots quickly the picture description says backlit keyboard but it is not whomever designed the website for asus should be fired i went through a big hassle trying to find an asus laptop that actually had the backlit keyboard that was advertised on several of their models but did not have it i wound up buying an asus 14 laptop that actually had the advertised backlit keyboard from office depotoffice max i had them verify it before i bought it usps delivered this today big box with a fairly big box and padding in it with a small and light laptop in that i had it unpacked and charging in no timesince i never intended to ever use the win10 installed on it or even boot it it took a bit to figure out how to get into the computer settings so that i could boot from a usb drive that i had linux mint installer loaded ona word of caution for those that are going to install linux the current popular install isos do not have the drivers for the wifi chip the drivers will have to be installed manually bluetooth does however work and i was easily able to link this computer to my iphone and get out to the internet that waywork a round i ordered a cheap 20 tp link usb 80211n only 25ghz wifi adapter plugged it in and it just works maybe someday linux will have drivers for the built in wifi chip in this devicewhile the only cpus that intel makes that are crapper than a celeron is a atom i found this on the webthe intel celeron n4020 is one of the most budgetfriendly and powerefficient laptop processors as for gaming the intel uhd 600 graphics of the celeron n4020 is one of the weakest solutions it can be used only for the lightest gamesto sum up the above it is a very cheap and uses very little powerfor its size the keyboard and screen are ok the keys have good travel it has a matte screenthis is a small and very light computer it is snappy enough surfing the web and running linux native applications while i am not clear on this but it appears that it can be charged with a standard usbc chargeri will have to take it out in the wild to see how the battery life holds up on it running linux the battery should last as least as long or longer than it does while running win10 i bought this laptop to use for leisure travel this next year wanted something bigger and more useful than the tablet i currently have while i have just started the setup process ie loading my apps files etc it is doing exactly what i wanted it to do i have switched to windows home installed all my apps and it is currently updating windows it is showing lots of promise this was a major selling feature for me since i work nights description needs updated it is fine otherwise but the trac pad stopped working a few days after we started using it recieved yesterdaystill reading info on using micro soft i am use to google use but this lap top has much more to offer it will take time to get use to it purchased this laptop in march 2021 and it only lasted six months with light use one day i could no longer connect to the internet ran the troubleshooter and it said it could not find a network adapter tried everything suggested but still cannot connect to the internet total waste of money i am giving this tablet two stars as it is inexpensive under 200 and lightweight other than that i would give it one star i should have read the description more carefully as it is not a touchscreen model get your fingers to work on the touchpad if hard enough but the way this was designed if you are not very careful you are constantly turning on the numbering feature it is a serious stupid design you have all the number above the alpha keys grab a calculator if you need it i waited too long on return it excellent for just information support for your job 365 micro soft is useless for the price you cannot complain it works for basic usage as browsing the internet i would recommend for anyone who needs a laptop with basic functionality easy to use up in a second i love it then i realized that i could not hear a damn thing i am on a computer 12 hours a day i know how to work them i adjusted the controlsblah blah could barely hear the volume on some things particularly youtube finally looked and lo and behold the speaker are on the bottom how in the hell can speakers project when you have the danged thing in your lap my thighs completely block all sound so in order to hear certain things i have to hold it up to my face yes i have trouble shooted everything yes i know what i am doing and yes i am sending it back sound sucks and i do not want to have a little speaker attached to the top so i can hear perfect for what it has been designed for internet browsing music playing videos can play terraria arrived without windows bootingupon boot enter bios and i get no bootable device you can tell the manual has been beat up when filling in return on amazon i find support phone number but despite being advertised as open nobody answers i dislike the confusion with it is programs not one to be a refresher onafter so many yearsi feel i made a mistake with choosing this laptop is smaller but has everything you need for school and very light so easy to travel with overall good computer for price sound stopped working completely after a week it will not turn on after having it led than 30 days what i expected it is cute and quiet but the screen is made in a way that you have to look at it at a certain angle or it feels weird on your eyes and only the center circle is bright while the edges appear dark i have never hated a laptop screen so much it is almost like it has a privacy screen on it well it really was not what i was looking for it is kind of slow and i really could not get too many good apps on it and it seems much smaller than what it is size is supposed to be i wanted this laptop to do only one thing act as the control for a label printer but it could not even do that it took forever to boot and everyday tasks kept crashing it totally useless i returned it as soon as i could get it to shutdown this computer was a great purchase for my son he likes to play roblox minecraft and steam games this computer has the capability and speed to play these games and plenty of room to hold them it is not a gaming computer but is capable of playing these games without too much lag time the touchpad that moves the mouse icon does like to stop responding to touch but simply press the f6 key to toggle it back on and off and it will start working or plug in a mouse the battery lasts an extremely long amount of time the display is very clear and good quality excellent product for the price the seller lucky trading has excellent customer service and was very helpful with communication and when i needed product support highly recommended i only needed the computer for zoom whenever i touched the mic i had to hit it several times to turn on mic to speak it was a pain so i returned the computer i prefer touch screen a larger screen it took about ten minutes to download google chrome and when it did simply opening a new tab on the app took at least two minutes for it to fully load i bought this laptop to use for writing and schoolwork but the speed was just unbearable much smaller than i imagine but was ok easy to carry around fast enough for my use dislike nothing i use it for work l like that it was easy to use it is a laptop and it does laptop things if you need it to do heavy intensive things it might not do the thingsbut if you keep your expectations low you will probably not be disappointed the size and range of motion is pretty cooledit the family safety automatically being turned on is irritating the dumbest thing i have ever seen i have taken some mins to set the computer up i do not want to spend more time screen might put some people off battery is phenomenal it is silent and the audio is fine perfect for on the go</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bought for school work. Doing good so far.Sleek., It's alright, I bought this laptop a week ago. The touch pad worked at first. Once, I upgraded Windows 10. The touch pad stopped working. I went to the Acer site, to download a new driver for this pos. Of course it didn't work. That's why I'm giving this a bad review! I've tried several things to fix this laptop. None of them worked!, My son loves his laptop, One of his favorite devices so far.. One suggestion by memory card to go along with this laptop, I purchased this for my online college classes and am so glad I did. Awesome product!, This computer has totally inadequate volume.  The return was readily accepted by the seller but when I actually took the computer into the UPS store, I had to pay $21 to have it shipped WITH the properly printed return label !  Never had to pay to return an Amazon purchase before!!!!  What a ripoff!!!, Best laptop for this price, 5 star, I love everything about this laptop!, Horribly horrible computer! Do not buy! Screen went out in less than a week! Only used it once or twice before it went to H E double hockey sticks to, The trackpad has scrapes in it when I got it. Returned it, it's been two weeks and I'm being told it will take another 2 weeks for my refund to process. The body is also thin plastic and not metal like some other aspire 7s, including the trackpad. Get another gaming laptop, the ROG zephyrus g14 is on sale at best buy right now for almost the same price with a better GPU &amp; CPU and an all aluminum chassis., Basically the one thing that turned me off is that it warns you not to download the Google browser because it may make it unstable., This will be my last Acer. I expect notebooks to last around  3 years and that is when you actually use it. I used this one as a spare and hardly used it at all. In fact I just found it does not even have a battery that you can take out. I would not recommend this product., GREAT little laptop. Performs well. I do mostly work on it (Microsoft Office, Audio editing on Audacity, minor video editing and some music composition with Sibelius) and it runs flawlessly. Occasionally I travel and play games on it (league of Legends and World of Warcraft) and it runs those just fine too (WoW on lower graphics settings). only down side to this machine is there's VERY little memory. Make absolutely sure you budget for cloud storage, or an external hard drive if you go with this machine., Not nearly enough RAM, slows up with just basic web browsing, This is a great laptop for the price, but the worst thing about it is the placement of the touchpad, it's on the left hand side below the keyboard, which makes no sense.  It should be centered or more on the right.The screen color is also a bit bright, so if you want to edit photos on here beware of that.  Also this thing is kinda heavy., This is not bad, but I would not buy it again. The speakers are horrible and under the computer. making it hard to hear (I am deaf) and you have to pick up the computer to hear them. The cap lock key does not a light on it let you know it is on. Drives me crazy. No CD Rom either.  :(, Love this laptop except why would you put the speakers on the bottom which makes the sound horrible?  At least make the max volume higher so you can at least hear without needing external speakers!, Initially, once I set everything up, I was pretty pleased with my purchase! But after a little over a month (and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month), the screen went black but the back-light on the keyboard was still on. So, I figured it just needed to be charged. I left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it. Still, lit keys but no screen. So I changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more. Came back to it, same thing. I tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference. I never took it out of \"S\" mode, and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs. Basically, just checked my email a few times. Now when I plug it in, nothing lights up. The adapter on the charger doesn't have any indicator light to show that it's working, so it could be a faulty power cord.I'm going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers. But in any case, a brand new device should last longer than a month.Now my return window has closed so I'm either stuck with a $350 paperweight, or I'll have to search online and buy a new charger and hope that works..., I do not spend a lot of time on the computer. I purchased the computer so I could do some personal writing. I like the fact that it had Microsoft Office installed. I did not like the the restriction to only use apps provided through the Microsoft store.  To download other apps, like zoom, I had to disable the Microsoft security system, which cannot now be reactivated on my machine.  But as far as general use of the computer, it has been great., Unfortunately, I have to write a bad review on this one. I have babied this laptop and while it was a decent for cheap laptop, I can't believe it just died on me after 14 months. I didn't get a warranty because the price was more than half of the laptop cost...again, inexpensive laptop. I expect slow, etc. but not death., Easy to set up, liked the keyboard. I added another 4 GB memory.  Just a nice overall laptop., It is a lot smaller screen, keyboard, etc., than I had before.  Though I had an Acer Aspire before.  I don't like it, probably will return it, and wouldn't recomment it for older people., Nice laptop for the money. I still don't like Windows. Battery life is lousy, My lab top has quit working. It will not restart it is froze &amp; my mouse will not work it won’t let me do anything, For the price point its a great laptop. First I added another 2GB RAM for under $20 and upgraded. Before I start with the positive one big negative. When the laptop goes to sleep mode, it take 25-40 sec before it wakes up. It's very strange. Its not a traditional hard drive. I didnt change any settings. I have to hit the power button and literally sit there for it to turn on. Pretty annoying. Other than that screen quality is phenomenal. Speed is more than adequate for MS office apps . It can also handle streaming and 8-10 browsers at a time.  For school, work , anything non hardcore this is a good laptop. Sound quality I aways use my bluetooth headset anyway. Sound is bit more towards the stereo sound. I am sure that can be adjusted, just havn't played with it.Like others have said, you cannot go wrong at this price point. I just hope it lasts and dont bog down or slow down with updates and what not...., this laptop is giving me nightmares. the touchpad is super sensitive to \"accidentally\" turning off. ok, fine. restart and it's back to normal if nothing else works (forgetting the inconvenience). then this morning after an update to windows 10, the touchpad isn't simply off. it isn't in settings, there are no drivers, it's just effing gone. so here i am, using a mouse i hate, because the laptop basically doesn't work as a laptop. take into consideration when thinking about purchasing this model. it's cheap, yes, but if you actually need to use on the go or in your lap, it's a bad choice., I purchased this laptop for general purposes as well as using the Cricut Desgin Space for my Cricut machine. My old laptop was just running too slowly and I needed an upgrade. First off, the price is amazing, and I'm fully aware that you get what you paid for but I feel like I got MORE than I paid for with this. I don't know much about specs and the ins and outs of computers so here are some pros and cons from a general user:PROS:- The look and design is very very sleek- Fairly lightweight- The screen resolution - AMAZING!- It seems fast so far- The battery life is very good. I've been working continuously for about three hours now without it plugged in and I still have 1/4 battery life left.- It does come downloaded with Windows 10 S Mode however there's literally a sticker directly on the box directing you to a website that explains a STUPIDLY EASY four step process to permanently get out of S mode. It was the first thing I did (based on other reviews) and have no issues. IT WAS FREE TO DO AND TOOK 2 MINUTES!!CONS:- Caps Lock/Num Lock do not have an indicator light. I'm already finding this very annoying but I use a USB keyboard most of the time anyway so it's fine.- The sound is awful. If you're using this laptop for streaming, games, etc. you will need headphones. No seriously... it's really bad. The quality is okay but it does not get loud AT ALL.Overall with a couple of days of use I'm impressed with this!!! Purchase ASAP if you're looking for an affordable general use laptop :), I bought this laptop for my wife for her job. I wanted something not pricey and just something that worked. I saw the high amount of five star reviews and I read through some of the lower starred reviews and thought, that won't happen to me, BS!!First of all, the computer got shipped quickly and got here undamaged but that is the only good I can say about it. The backlight for the keyboard goes off quickly and you have to press a key to turn it back on instead of moving the mouse and you cannot change it. As you may have read in other reviews, the computer comes with Windows 10 S Mode installed but my product key is not genuine. It says that the digital license is not valid. Because of this it WILL NOT ACTIVATE WINDOWS. Which means I CANNOT TAKE IT OUT OF S MODE. If the computer is in S Mode then you cannot download any apps or programs that you would normally use like Mozilla or VLC or even Chrome. And furthermore, you cannot access the Command Prompt which means you cannot even activate the Windows even if you wanted to.I have contacted Microsoft who told me that they could not do anything and to contact ACER. I contacted ACER and they told me to try one single thing, which I already did and confirmed that it does not work, then told me I had to send in the laptop to the techs which would take another two weeks just to get it back.Sooooooooooooooooo, long story short, it is a never ending loop of disappointment, anger and resentment and a complete waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE., This laptop was overpriced., Screen quality is decentTouch screen not reallyThis isn’t a gaming laptopTurn off the wifi so it doesnt interfere with your cell phones connectivity or other tablet/computer., Overall, a great laptop for the price. I added 8G of RAM really easily. It is fast and cheap. However, some technical issues:- S mode is horrible. Got rid of it immediately.- My powerpoint screen recording function would not work. Called Microsoft and they were very helpful. They rolled back my display driver to Microsoft Basic and worked perfectly, but then the computer would not recognize my second screen. Called Acer, and they told me they didn't have another display driver to download and referred me to a third party (Answers By) that wanted to charge me $99 to fix the issue...- For some reason, the internet was really slow. Played with two different routers I had. It was still slow even with a tri-band router and no other devices connected to the internet. Then, I connected to the guest wifi I had set up and it worked perfectly. I suspect this may be a driver/software issue.For the price, it is hard to beat this, but get ready for some compatibility issues and no support from ACER..., THIS PC WAS GOOD BUT THE CAMERA DID NOT WORK I OPENED CASE THEY COULD NOT FIS IT  POOR PRODUCT SUPPORT DOD NOT BUY THIS PC  DO NOT BUY THIS PC. VERY POOR SUPPORT FROM AMAZON AND ACER, Product wouldn’t work out of the box, and after an hour with tech support made the decision to return., I love everything about this laptop. Especially the built in Alexa. It's so sleek and stylish. My daughter told me it looked just like her MAC laptop. Best buy anywhere for a laptop at a reasonable price with all the features!, Arrived late, Speaker volume is low.great LT for price! Won’t find anywhere else., Stopped working after 4 months of light use., The first time I attempted to use my webcam for a important Zoom interview, it would not work. After Acer did hours of trouble shooting, with no resolve, they told me I had no other choice but to reset my laptop to factory settings, which meant I lost almost everything I had on my laptop. When it was determined that losing all of my content was for nothing, they finally checked the device manager and discovered that no Webcam drivers had been installed! They then told me that I would have to pay to send the laptop back to them for repairs! I refused to pay out anything more. Needless to say I Will Never purchase from Acer again.!, Hard Drive crashed after 7 months and it was going to cost more than the computer to fix., Product arrived on time and was as advertised.  No surprises., Nothing special about this. Recent buy, no issues thus far. Appreciate the graphics card vs the \"newer model\" with the integrated card. Helps with some lighter games and other graphics-intensive apps., Horrible product. Bought it in March and it keeps disconnecting from the internet, sound is absolutely horrible. Now I have a laptop that is absolutely useless., It will not stay connected to WiFi - I constantly have to reconnect to wifi even after just a few minutes of inactivity., Everything is good for the price but  the volume  is to low... l had to return and get an apple instead. Even though it is double the price., This is a nice laptop for the price.  No issues so far at all.  I did need to take it out of S mode in order to install Zoom which is basically mandatory these days., The batter life is trash, and heats up fast, I bought this entry level Acer as an extra to have around and wasn't expecting much for the price.  Everything about this computer is very good EXCEPT for the low volume of the sound.  I'm not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume. I wasn't expecting BOSE quality, but I was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100%; it isn't.  Here's what I did, checked drivers, opened the Realtek to confirm all were set at 100%.  Upon researching other reviews, I noticed similar low volume issues; it appears that this is where Acer skimped. (I have an entry level Toshiba that has horrible quality sound, but it is loud.) I need to Blu-tooth an external speaker just so I don't have to bring my ears to w/in 8\" just to hear.  Of course, it doesn't help that Acer put the speakers on the bottom, yes, the bottom of the unit. It's a shame that Acer did so much right for the price, only to mess up on a incredibly low volume!  Would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100%?  The answer to my rhetorical question is no, but they did anyway.Overall, I would have given the unit 4 stars, maybe even 5, but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3, at best, unfortunately.My take-away is that I won't buy another Acer without hearing the sound first., built in camera and mic not working, Computer works well. Still trying to learn the operating system as it is different from the last computer., Worked fine for 13 months of occasional use, and then out of nowhere, the motherboard failed--just outside of the mfr warranty window. Piece of junk!, I absolutely love this laptop, key board lights went out and i am a senior citizen with eye problems who runs a help line to get services for families trying to get moms into recovery and am limited in times i can help to day times when i can see the keys, Microsoft edge is the worst browser first off, secondly this laptop did an automatic update and deleted several of my saved documents which are unrecoverable- hours of work are lost. It also blanked out 4x during a timed midterm exam last week.I have had this laptop for just 6 months - sad to say, I won’t purchase Acer again., I purchased this product based on many reviews .  After waiting 30 minutes to set up this thing, I called Acer support.  This thing would not set up Windows.  There is a 22 digit serial number that has to be provided fast and you have to use a telescope since the type is very small and is located no where near where the tech said it was.  Am going on 3 hours now to fully set thing up and am about ready to send it back.  Pure frustration.  This thing has all kinds of features but one important feature it lacks is the ability to set it up without having to take 3 hours of your life to do so.  Recommend you buy something else., overall its an ok computer , but the speakers seems damaged, its extremely low and theres a feedback, Computer works great, just as advertised, good value, would buy again, Works exactly how I expected it to and does everything I need it to do. A very good laptop for the price given., I got this for gaming by day 3 the touch pad stopped working. I troubleshooted it for days. Nothing worked. It only works with a mouse. I was very disappointed. I returned this item and will buy a different brand. Really sucks cause I liked it for gaming☹️, I have been very satisfied with this purchase so far.  I've only had it set up for less than a week, so I can't really state how well the battery is going to be,,,but so far it is great.  I have only had one small problem with setting up the email, but I'm just going on my web browser and accessing it from there, not sure what the problem is, probably something on my \"non-thechie\" side of the screen.  It is a great value for the money and I have absolutely no complaints.  The best feature I have found so far is the back lit keyboard....I had no idea how wonderful this would be....it's great.  I used to have to squint or turn on a light, but not anymore.  It's really an amazing little labptop and the screen is crystal clear.  The speed is very fast and so far I am loving this laptop way more than the last 2 Hewlett Packards that I have had to replace due to faulty battery setting.  I love this computer., Works like a charm, Keyboard start to having pressing issue after a while. Specially the one you use most. Otherwise it’s a great computer, I bought this computer for a new full time remote position. The computer is great for VERY BASIC NEEDS. Only a couple tabs open and browsing the internet. I needed to have 10+ tabs open and be able to toggle back and forth very quickly for my role and this computer could unfortunately not keep up. If you need something faster, I would get the same computer but with an i5 processor for $200 more. Well worth the difference. Have had the new computer for a week and it runs remarkable faster and can keep up with what I need done.Also, I plugged in a bluetooth mouse to this computer, and once I unplugged it, I could not get the touch pad to work anymore, so it is a good thing I am returning it as it also had this alternative issue., backlit keyboard is nice, but I hate to have to pay for word processing.  I hate this \"Gortana\" which pops up all the time., it is a cheaper computer that does its job.But the mouse pad thing doesn't work anymore. so I have to use a external mouse, This has the potential to be a good computer, but Acer ships this in S mode. Windows 10 Home cannot be activated. Running SLUI 4 will open the installation ID, but Microsoft cannot activate that number.  The agent said I needed to call Acer.  I called the toll-free number included with the computer and was told by that agent to call Microsoft (whodathunk?) or send it to Acer to be \"repaired.\"  It was out of the box for ten minutes and they wanted it to be repaired! Thanks to Amazon-- it is being returned.  Run  Away., I purchased this computer for my small business job. Within two weeks of use, the down key came off. Amazon's response is to glue the key down, which is ABSURD. You can't just glue a key down, which I explained, but they said that is all that they could do. They would not replace the computer., I purchased this laptop for school / social media / youtube / browsing &amp; i absolutley love it. No complaints so far., It’s really good I actually got it two days earlier than they said they were going to send it to me which that is great, Not lasting more then 1hr! And lagging when you unplug the cable., Still working on this. Hope to up my rating if we can get things working. First experience with the system was very positive. Issue is that on day two I saw a message in the lower right corner of the screen: \"Go to settings to Activate Windows\". Settings says \"We can't activate Windows on this device because you don't have a valid digital license or product key. If you think you have a valid license or key, select Troubleshoot below. Troubleshooter says \"Something interrupted our troubleshooting.\" Called Acer support and was told they would mail me Windows Installation USB memory stick. Waited a little over one week and asked for status update. Was told that USB install media was not available, and I should contact Microsoft for activation. Entered last four digits from activation error message and was told I would need a new product key. Contacted Acer support again, and was told we would need to return the computer to the factory for fix; which could take 15-20 business days, plus shipping time. Briefly considered returning to Amazon, be decided to try the Acer service option. Will be awhile before we get it back., The physical device is very nice.  Lighted keyboard good EXCEPT no indicators for Caps Lock nor Num Lock.  That is unfortunate (what, Acer saved $2 to not include two little leds). Bluetooth non-operating out of the box so will need to troubleshoot.  Touchpad stopped functioning after a few weeks - another thing to troubleshoot...  Hope that is all the bad stuff that happens to this new machine., We got this as a grad. gift for our grandson. Great price, great laptop &amp; fast delivery!!, Flimsy.  Returned it., Finally unboxed this laptop.. have not used much but the charger that came with it is not original making me think it's a refurbished laptop advertised as 'new' or sent a used one.. will update this review when I've used it a bit..if I don't return it..., It very light weight but not very fast. Screen quality it’s good., Purchased this for a high school kid. Does what it needs to do. The base model is ok. I like that you can upgrade this in the future. They included the bracket for a secondary drive. I will be buying more of these for clients, Works well for school Wish I had read I to description more No sd card or disc reader So cost wasn’t as well as I thought after buying external  readers, Windows does not run as smoothly on the Acer as it did on my Dell. My games do not work as well. Have to refresh page often when searching on internet. Not happy with this product., Can’t complain about an Acer product for the price and quality!, I live everything about it except the battery lifeI constantly has to recharge it to appoint i just kept it plugged most of the time, A good performance., To summarize, you get what you pay for. I was not expecting to run into so many problems right when I took this out of the box.1. Immediately I heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when I pulled it out of its packaging.2. The sound is so bad it's like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store. The speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality.3. Loud fan when it gets a little warm when using.4. Scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs. I had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos I noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs.5. Customer service from both Acer and Amazon makes it difficult to fix your/my issues. I contacted customer service the same day after I received this laptop and also the day after. After telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to Acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed.6. Possible restocking fee. Wanting to return this item, even though I barely used it the first 2 days, customer service told me that I cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it BEFORE they can tell me whether or not I will be charged a restocking fee. If you don't like being surprised by restocking fees, don't buy this laptop so you won't have to return.7, I was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem (basically to spend more money just so I can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file.8. Screen quality is definitely not good. I would give it a 6/10. The color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor, the difference is super noticeable.9. 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me. You would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you're basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usable.I know this has good reviews but don't be fooled by it. I was swayed when I was going through the reviews but after I got my product, I was highly disappointed. I wish I had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop. This one is not worth the regular price. I would say with the issues and quality of this laptop, the price should be around $250., Works fine.  Sound could be louder., I tried 3 of them they perform differently from each other and they appeared to have different hardware suppliers internal parts made by random manufacturers for example M.2 port is only PCIE X2 speed  and advertised internal sata3 port performs about 300mb write and 500mb read on a drive rated 530mb write 550mb read.Over it looks as if it was put together in a hurry debris around plastic body can easily can cut hands skin etc., This laptop is great and I had it for months, but when I first got it I had to pay another 100 dollars to take s mode off of it., The computer itself is great for basic use (checking email, browsing the internet, writing papers, etc). I bought it because I have a MacBook and most Department of Defense websites aren’t compatible with Mac OS. My biggest complaint is that 1 month into owning it, the charging cable doesn’t seem to work anymore and I’m terrified for the day that the battery dies and I have no way of charging it after that., Not good as described. Not hapoy with battery performance., It's a great laptop sometimes it can act a bit uppity but just restart it if you just installed some apps. Also it comes on S mode which you can change to regular windows 10 for FREE!  Go in settings &gt; application &gt; Switch to windows 10 mode, Good laptop but ended returning, found one better., Cheap laptop.  You get what you pay for.  No hard drive.  No cd player.  Mouse board difficult to control., The product key on the laptop was bad and so I could not activate it. Acer customer support was horrible, told me if I had bought it directly from them they could have given me a new product key but since I bought it from Amazon I'm pretty much on my own. Last time I buy this brand., Machine is a really great budget machine. I got it for my wife for school but more than just a throw away machine. In the standard form, it was nothing great. Adding more RAM woke it up a lot. Better overall performance.The back-lit keyboard is huge plus for working at night. Screen resolution and clarity is great as well., I had to return my laptop after the mouse cursor had mysteriously quit working after 3 days of use. While I am used toto Apple products, I tried troubleshooting my Windows laptop, even tried restarting in Safe Mode to troubleshoot, without resolve. I even performed Windows Recovery. Still, no resolve. Confused, I thought, That’s okay, I am within the allotted time to return my laptop. So, I requested a Return and opted for a new replacement (vs. refund). I was careful to ensure I remained in compliance with the Return Policy as set out by Amazon and followed the instructions, step-by-step. I downloaded the RA# and UPS label provided and used it to return my laptop as instructed. The following day, I checked the Amazon website for status of my return, only to discover that all information about my return mysteriously disappeared! I didn’t think much of it as more than a temporary technical error, as it was admittedly nearing the deadline for return. Having carefully followed instructions per Amazon’s Return Policy and with my Proof of Shipment Receipt from UPS, I was confident it would work itself out. NOPE. Evidently not. More than two weeks later, NO REPLACEMENT, NO REFUND, NO RESPONSE. …NO COMMUNICATION. And, Four to Five text messages later to the Seller (via Amazon website) — along w/ submission of my proof of shipment receipt and tracking# — STILL NO RECORD OF iNITIATION OR TRACKING OF MY RETURN. The History of my messages to Amazon / Seller and my Return Request are also *POOF* GONE!What the $&amp;@! NO PHONE NUMBERS; Just the runAround.Apparently, I am now out $500 — AND a laptop. …Fabulous.KNOW THE RISK!, This laptop is 14\"!!! I'm soooo angry!, This laptop is great, its affordable and have a bunch of cool features. The only issue is that it is extremely low. you definitely need a headset or speakers. I have to lift the device to my ears to hear if I dont have any of these available.  I have had it for a year and so far so good., I love it.  Easy to work with, screen is small. whole computer is really a tiny bit larger than a notebook, but the processor is fast and all.. I thought i was upgrading, but i have to wear glasses when using this thing to see the letters., I HAVE ORDERED FOUR ACER LAPTOPS FROM AMAZON IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND LOVE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE BUY A FIFTH ACER LAPTOP, AFTER READING ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS ONE. THEY WERE WRONG AND VERY MISLEADING. I SHOULD HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, THEY WERE ACCURATE. THIS ACER LAPTOP WAS THE WORST, SOUND SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE, YOU CAN BARELY HEAR IT EVEN IF YOU TURN IT UP TO THE MAX, THE MOUSE PAD AND KEYS WERE UNRESPONSIVE, CAN'T ADJUST THE SETTINGS, ETC. I USED IT FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY MINUTES,..... 30 MINUTES  AFTER I CHARGED IT AND I PUT IT RIGHT BACK  IN THE PACKAGING.  I COULD NOT GET IT OUT OF MY HOUSE FAST ENOUGH.  WITHIN AN HOUR, I CALLED AMAZON FOR RETURN AUTHORIZATION TO PICK UP THE LAPTOP THE FOLLOWING DAY.  I GOT MY FULL REFUND, AMAZON'S EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE SAVED THE DAY.  GREATLY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS ACER LAPTOP. BUYER BEWARE., Cons:-over heats-speakers are horrible can barely hear videos (had to install an additional app to make sound louder)-computer lags a bit (shouldn’t lag for the price of it)- not recommend for the pricePros:-Good quality when watching videos etc, I like everything about this computer EXCEPT THE VOLUME-YOU CAN BARELY HEAR ANYTHING ON IT!, dislike the teeny hddlike I can throw an external drive on it and am gtg after taking it OUT of s modenear perfect for my needs and decent price, Not touchscreen as was advertised in the question and answer section. The graphics are so so. Worse than my last Acer. Overall 4 stars., Good computer. I’m using it to create elearning.When I tried to remove the computer from Windows S mode, I realized that the computer did not come with a product key. What this means is in order to remove S mode, you have to buy Windows Home or Pro and use the product key to remove S mode. I wish they would have just told me that! I contacted the company via amazon chat, they said I needed to contact the manufacturer. They gave me a phone number. There is a button on amazon to contact the manufacturer as well. No success.I ended up just buying the downloadable Windows home version and used the product key to remove S mode. I also purchased the microsoft software for powerpoint, word, excel, etc.That's a lot of drama just to be able to download things to my computer. Just know that you are buying a bare bones computer when you purchase., Was a great computer until I had used it twice for Zoom and now the speakers no longer work.  If I figure out why I will update., When I first received this laptop everything seemed great, I was very excited to set it up with my personal information and get going-- I very quickly realized, however, that this computer was EXTREMELY slow for my tastes.  Even with no background programs, simple tasks like opening file explorer or a web browser took far too much time.  In my opinion, a brand new computer should be opening programs almost instantly, not leaving me waiting a few seconds or more.  This is ultimately preference, but I'm sure there are many more laptops out there for a similar price point that would run much faster.  Returned this after only a day or so of having it and ended up with another laptop from the early 2010's and it runs much better than this one., I had this laptop for about 2 months now and I'm loving it so far. It's lightweight, sleek, and the backlit keys are great for me in my dark room. It boots up in seconds ready to go when you turn it on. I mostly use this for watching videos and streams and excels it that. The only negative that I can think of is the placement of the speakers. The speakers are placed on the bottom and really muffle the sound so my volume is always at max. Other than that the laptop is a great budget buy., Displeased. Some black (looks more like green) dotted lines are running down the middle of my screen. Looks like some kind of defect. The laptop was purchased at the start of September and didnt see usage until about the 25th of September, which means In about two months this situation happened. Was satisfied with my purchase before this occurrence., I’m not sure if it has “touch screen”., Poor quality. Cheap, just like the price. Laptop is unlikely to last you long. Charging port was junk.On the positive side, it is very light and small.If you choose to purchase this laptop, best of luck to you., The battery died after a week and the screen started blinking. I needed to connect an external monitor to work. BAD BAD BAD., I was told I was going to get a new battery sent to me because every since I have the laptop it will only turn on if it is plugged in to the wall and i never received a new one.., very cheesy one , keep freezing ,not able open files or photos , not going waste my time to fight that, I love this laptop. The screen is a great size. It’s light weight not heavy and very sleek., Good laptop, I don't do anything out of the ordinary.  Does what a laptop is made to do.  I stayed with ACER because my previous laptop was ACER.  If it didn't lose the 'W' key function I'd still be using it, but would buy a new battery because unless it's plugged in it randomly shuts down, bad battery. So, the new laptop had a new surprise.  The sound volume is very poor.  Now lugging a wifi speaker along wherever the laptop goes.  I have to not recommend for this very reason., Absolute garbage, I really dont write reviews but when I do I usually make them for the people this laptop is good when it works but I only used this about 10 times and now it does not charge or turn on pretty much got robbed I'm really disappointed I was really hyped about this product but no durability whatsoever no scratch or anything looks brand new and it's a lemon buyers beware., Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop 15.6 inches Full HD computer stop working this month July 2021.  I purchase this item in October 2020 as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  Unfortunately, the computer has stop working and the battery will not charge.  Please contact me in reference to the warranty information.  I would not purchase another computer through AMAZON.  No customer service support when needed., bought this for my brother laid up with back surgery-easy to work great graphics and definitely user friendly!, All ok so far, cute unit--but does not work after two hours =  black screen &amp; deadmay i have a replacement unit?, I love this computer, but the mouse pad doesn’t work. Had to buy a wireless mouse to even use it. But otherwise great product, Good quality, use it to work from home and meetings and classed., I faced several issues with this PC in spite on light usage. First google meet does not work on all browsers and suddenly mutes the conversation. We spent ages trying to solve this problem until we discovered that it works only on microsoft edge.Sound quality is not clear and low.Finally the battery stopped charging and the laptop does not work except when it is plugged in power. All of this happened after less than 8 months of usage.A total waste of money, The product arrived with a bad wireless card. I returned the item and the refund was applied to a Amazon gift card instead of my credit card. I am not happy., I’ve had this computer for a year and for some reason the computer won’t work unless it’s plugged in. I originally got it for college, but the pandemic caused me to stay and do school at home. I haven’t spilled anything or dropped the computer so I don’t know what the problem is., Nice PC but the backlighting went out after 3 weeks and Acer couldn't help me. Having a laptop without being able to see the keys is not good., Bought one year ago, already falling apart. Lacks durability.  Good for a few months, then you'll need a new one.  The input to the power cord is broken and now the laptop won't charge.  The lever that opens and closes the laptop pulled apart. Stay away.  Terrible quality., I baught this laptop and after just a month and a half the mouse pad won't work. Scam, ALL ELSE OK, I regret buying this laptop and spending all the extra money in shipping.I am having two major troubles with this laptop:1 - The laptop slows down and lags badly once unplugged from power. It runs fast and fine when plugged. It's so bad. I have gone to Control panel and under power settings created a different profile for high performance and gone to advanced power settings and set everything to high performance and still the issue persists.I upgraded the RAM to 16GB. Same issue. I have done countless troubleshooting as seen on different websites, my windows is updated. I have switched off most background and start-up apps and it's still same. I just don't understand why I can't have the freedom to use my laptop at high performance when unplugged. This is crazy. I'm suspecting AMD and Acer to be behind this. This issue sometimes doesn't happen but most times it does.2. Second issue is that when connected to hotspot, this device will from time to time shut off internet connection for not obvious reason.So I could be in the middle of an important zoom meeting and off she goes.Don't buy this if you want peace of mind. The back cover also is inferior plastic., Considering I had a Toshiba laptop for over 10 years with no problems, I expected better of this. But two months into it the touch pad and cursor died. Fortunately I still had the wireless mouse and keyboard so the laptop is still functional.I don't have the time or patience to fool around with a return. When I buy a product I expect it to work. We'll see how long it lasts., Track pad broke within 1 month of use. Amazon was no help., Extremely happy with this. I have a laptop i can take on the go for long business trips even upgraded the ram to make it even better. Glad i found this.</td>\n",
       "      <td>bought for school work doing good so farsleek it is alright i bought this laptop a week ago the touch pad worked at first once i upgraded windows 10 the touch pad stopped working i went to the acer site to download a new driver for this pos of course it did not work that is why i am giving this a bad review i have tried several things to fix this laptop none of them worked my son loves his laptop one of his favorite devices so far one suggestion by memory card to go along with this laptop i purchased this for my online college classes and am so glad i did awesome product this computer has totally inadequate volume the return was readily accepted by the seller but when i actually took the computer into the ups store i had to pay 21 to have it shipped with the properly printed return label never had to pay to return an amazon purchase before what a ripoff best laptop for this price 5 star i love everything about this laptop horribly horrible computer do not buy screen went out in less than a week only used it once or twice before it went to h e double hockey sticks to the trackpad has scrapes in it when i got it returned it it is been two weeks and i am being told it will take another 2 weeks for my refund to process the body is also thin plastic and not metal like some other aspire 7s including the trackpad get another gaming laptop the rog zephyrus g14 is on sale at best buy right now for almost the same price with a better gpu cpu and an all aluminum chassis basically the one thing that turned me off is that it warns you not to download the google browser because it may make it unstable this will be my last acer i expect notebooks to last around 3 years and that is when you actually use it i used this one as a spare and hardly used it at all in fact i just found it does not even have a battery that you can take out i would not recommend this product great little laptop performs well i do mostly work on it microsoft office audio editing on audacity minor video editing and some music composition with sibelius and it runs flawlessly occasionally i travel and play games on it league of legends and world of warcraft and it runs those just fine too wow on lower graphics settings only down side to this machine is there is very little memory make absolutely sure you budget for cloud storage or an external hard drive if you go with this machine not nearly enough ram slows up with just basic web browsing this is a great laptop for the price but the worst thing about it is the placement of the touchpad it is on the left hand side below the keyboard which makes no sense it should be centered or more on the rightthe screen color is also a bit bright so if you want to edit photos on here beware of that also this thing is kind of heavy this is not bad but i would not buy it again the speakers are horrible and under the computer making it hard to hear i am deaf and you have to pick up the computer to hear them the cap lock key does not a light on it let you know it is on drives me crazy no cd rom either love this laptop except why would you put the speakers on the bottom which makes the sound horrible at least make the max volume higher so you can at least hear without needing external speakers initially once i set everything up i was pretty pleased with my purchase but after a little over a month and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month the screen went black but the backlight on the keyboard was still on so i figured it just needed to be charged i left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it still lit keys but no screen so i changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more came back to it same thing i tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference i never took it out of s mode and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs basically just checked my email a few times now when i plug it in nothing lights up the adapter on the charger does not have any indicator light to show that it is working so it could be a faulty power cordi am going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers but in any case a brand new device should last longer than a monthnow my return window has closed so i am either stuck with a 350 paperweight or i will have to search online and buy a new charger and hope that works i do not spend a lot of time on the computer i purchased the computer so i could do some personal writing i like the fact that it had microsoft office installed i did not like the the restriction to only use apps provided through the microsoft store to download other apps like zoom i had to disable the microsoft security system which cannot now be reactivated on my machine but as far as general use of the computer it has been great unfortunately i have to write a bad review on this one i have babied this laptop and while it was a decent for cheap laptop i cannot believe it just died on me after 14 months i did not get a warranty because the price was more than half of the laptop costagain inexpensive laptop i expect slow etc but not death easy to set up liked the keyboard i added another 4 gb memory just a nice overall laptop it is a lot smaller screen keyboard etc than i had before though i had an acer aspire before i do not like it probably will return it and would not recomment it for older people nice laptop for the money i still do not like windows battery life is lousy my lab top has quit working it will not restart it is froze my mouse will not work it will not let me do anything for the price point its a great laptop first i added another 2gb ram for under 20 and upgraded before i start with the positive one big negative when the laptop goes to sleep mode it take 2540 sec before it wakes up it is very strange its not a traditional hard drive i did not change any settings i have to hit the power button and literally sit there for it to turn on pretty annoying other than that screen quality is phenomenal speed is more than adequate for ms office apps it can also handle streaming and 810 browsers at a time for school work anything non hardcore this is a good laptop sound quality i aways use my bluetooth headset anyway sound is bit more towards the stereo sound i am sure that can be adjusted just havnt played with itlike others have said you cannot go wrong at this price point i just hope it lasts and do not bog down or slow down with updates and what not this laptop is giving me nightmares the touchpad is super sensitive to accidentally turning off ok fine restart and it is back to normal if nothing else works forgetting the inconvenience then this morning after an update to windows 10 the touchpad is not simply off it is not in settings there are no drivers it is just effing gone so here i am using a mouse i hate because the laptop basically does not work as a laptop take into consideration when thinking about purchasing this model it is cheap yes but if you actually need to use on the go or in your lap it is a bad choice i purchased this laptop for general purposes as well as using the cricut desgin space for my cricut machine my old laptop was just running too slowly and i needed an upgrade first off the price is amazing and i am fully aware that you get what you paid for but i feel like i got more than i paid for with this i do not know much about specs and the ins and outs of computers so here are some pros and cons from a general userpros the look and design is very very sleek fairly lightweight the screen resolution amazing it seems fast so far the battery life is very good i have been working continuously for about three hours now without it plugged in and i still have 14 battery life left it does come downloaded with windows 10 s mode however there is literally a sticker directly on the box directing you to a website that explains a stupidly easy four step process to permanently get out of s mode it was the first thing i did based on other reviews and have no issues it was free to do and took 2 minutescons caps locknum lock do not have an indicator light i am already finding this very annoying but i use a usb keyboard most of the time anyway so it is fine the sound is awful if you are using this laptop for streaming games etc you will need headphones no seriously it is really bad the quality is okay but it does not get loud at alloverall with a couple of days of use i am impressed with this purchase as soon as possible if you are looking for an affordable general use laptop i bought this laptop for my wife for her job i wanted something not pricey and just something that worked i saw the high amount of five star reviews and i read through some of the lower starred reviews and thought that will not happen to me bsfirst of all the computer got shipped quickly and got here undamaged but that is the only good i can say about it the backlight for the keyboard goes off quickly and you have to press a key to turn it back on instead of moving the mouse and you cannot change it as you may have read in other reviews the computer comes with windows 10 s mode installed but my product key is not genuine it says that the digital license is not valid because of this it will not activate windows which means i cannot take it out of s mode if the computer is in s mode then you cannot download any apps or programs that you would normally use like mozilla or vlc or even chrome and furthermore you cannot access the command prompt which means you cannot even activate the windows even if you wanted toi have contacted microsoft who told me that they could not do anything and to contact acer i contacted acer and they told me to try one single thing which i already did and confirmed that it does not work then told me i had to send in the laptop to the techs which would take another two weeks just to get it backsooooooooooooooooo long story short it is a never ending loop of disappointment anger and resentment and a complete waste of time and money do not buy save yourself the trouble this laptop was overpriced screen quality is decenttouch screen not reallythis is not a gaming laptopturn off the wifi so it does not interfere with your cell phones connectivity or other tabletcomputer overall a great laptop for the price i added 8g of ram really easily it is fast and cheap however some technical issues s mode is horrible got rid of it immediately my powerpoint screen recording function would not work called microsoft and they were very helpful they rolled back my display driver to microsoft basic and worked perfectly but then the computer would not recognize my second screen called acer and they told me they did not have another display driver to download and referred me to a third party answers by that wanted to charge me 99 to fix the issue for some reason the internet was really slow played with two different routers i had it was still slow even with a triband router and no other devices connected to the internet then i connected to the guest wifi i had set up and it worked perfectly i suspect this may be a driversoftware issuefor the price it is hard to beat this but get ready for some compatibility issues and no support from acer this pc was good but the camera did not work i opened case they could not fis it poor product support dod not buy this pc do not buy this pc very poor support from amazon and acer product would not work out of the box and after an hour with tech support made the decision to return i love everything about this laptop especially the built in alexa it is so sleek and stylish my daughter told me it looked just like her mac laptop best buy anywhere for a laptop at a reasonable price with all the features arrived late speaker volume is lowgreat lt for price will not find anywhere else stopped working after 4 months of light use the first time i attempted to use my webcam for a important zoom interview it would not work after acer did hours of trouble shooting with no resolve they told me i had no other choice but to reset my laptop to factory settings which meant i lost almost everything i had on my laptop when it was determined that losing all of my content was for nothing they finally checked the device manager and discovered that no webcam drivers had been installed they then told me that i would have to pay to send the laptop back to them for repairs i refused to pay out anything more needless to say i will never purchase from acer again hard drive crashed after 7 months and it was going to cost more than the computer to fix product arrived on time and was as advertised no surprises nothing special about this recent buy no issues thus far appreciate the graphics card vs the newer model with the integrated card helps with some lighter games and other graphicsintensive apps horrible product bought it in march and it keeps disconnecting from the internet sound is absolutely horrible now i have a laptop that is absolutely useless it will not stay connected to wifi i constantly have to reconnect to wifi even after just a few minutes of inactivity everything is good for the price but the volume is to low l had to return and get an apple instead even though it is double the price this is a nice laptop for the price no issues so far at all i did need to take it out of s mode in order to install zoom which is basically mandatory these days the batter life is trash and heats up fast i bought this entry level acer as an extra to have around and was not expecting much for the price everything about this computer is very good except for the low volume of the sound i am not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume i was not expecting bose quality but i was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100 it is not here is what i did checked drivers opened the realtek to confirm all were set at 100 upon researching other reviews i noticed similar low volume issues it appears that this is where acer skimped i have an entry level toshiba that has horrible quality sound but it is loud i need to blutooth an external speaker just so i do not have to bring my ears to win 8 just to hear of course it does not help that acer put the speakers on the bottom yes the bottom of the unit it is a shame that acer did so much right for the price only to mess up on a incredibly low volume would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100 the answer to my rhetorical question is no but they did anywayoverall i would have given the unit 4 stars maybe even 5 but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3 at best unfortunatelymy takeaway is that i will not buy another acer without hearing the sound first built in camera and mic not working computer works well still trying to learn the operating system as it is different from the last computer worked fine for 13 months of occasional use and then out of nowhere the motherboard failedjust outside of the mfr warranty window piece of junk i absolutely love this laptop key board lights went out and i am a senior citizen with eye problems who runs a help line to get services for families trying to get moms into recovery and am limited in times i can help to day times when i can see the keys microsoft edge is the worst browser first off secondly this laptop did an automatic update and deleted several of my saved documents which are unrecoverable hours of work are lost it also blanked out 4x during a timed midterm exam last weeki have had this laptop for just 6 months sad to say i will not purchase acer again i purchased this product based on many reviews after waiting 30 minutes to set up this thing i called acer support this thing would not set up windows there is a 22 digit serial number that has to be provided fast and you have to use a telescope since the type is very small and is located no where near where the tech said it was am going on 3 hours now to fully set thing up and am about ready to send it back pure frustration this thing has all kinds of features but one important feature it lacks is the ability to set it up without having to take 3 hours of your life to do so recommend you buy something else overall its an ok computer but the speakers seems damaged its extremely low and there is a feedback computer works great just as advertised good value would buy again works exactly how i expected it to and does everything i need it to do a very good laptop for the price given i got this for gaming by day 3 the touch pad stopped working i troubleshooted it for days nothing worked it only works with a mouse i was very disappointed i returned this item and will buy a different brand really sucks because i liked it for gaming i have been very satisfied with this purchase so far i have only had it set up for less than a week so i cannot really state how well the battery is going to bebut so far it is great i have only had one small problem with setting up the email but i am just going on my web browser and accessing it from there not sure what the problem is probably something on my nonthechie side of the screen it is a great value for the money and i have absolutely no complaints the best feature i have found so far is the back lit keyboardi had no idea how wonderful this would beit is great i used to have to squint or turn on a light but not anymore it is really an amazing little labptop and the screen is crystal clear the speed is very fast and so far i am loving this laptop way more than the last 2 hewlett packards that i have had to replace due to faulty battery setting i love this computer works like a charm keyboard start to having pressing issue after a while specially the one you use most otherwise it is a great computer i bought this computer for a new full time remote position the computer is great for very basic needs only a couple tabs open and browsing the internet i needed to have 10 tabs open and be able to toggle back and forth very quickly for my role and this computer could unfortunately not keep up if you need something faster i would get the same computer but with an i5 processor for 200 more well worth the difference have had the new computer for a week and it runs remarkable faster and can keep up with what i need donealso i plugged in a bluetooth mouse to this computer and once i unplugged it i could not get the touch pad to work anymore so it is a good thing i am returning it as it also had this alternative issue backlit keyboard is nice but i hate to have to pay for word processing i hate this gortana which pops up all the time it is a cheaper computer that does its jobbut the mouse pad thing does not work anymore so i have to use a external mouse this has the potential to be a good computer but acer ships this in s mode windows 10 home cannot be activated running slui 4 will open the installation id but microsoft cannot activate that number the agent said i needed to call acer i called the tollfree number included with the computer and was told by that agent to call microsoft whodathunk or send it to acer to be repaired it was out of the box for ten minutes and they wanted it to be repaired thanks to amazon it is being returned run away i purchased this computer for my small business job within two weeks of use the down key came off amazons response is to glue the key down which is absurd you cannot just glue a key down which i explained but they said that is all that they could do they would not replace the computer i purchased this laptop for school social media youtube browsing i absolutley love it no complaints so far it is really good i actually got it two days earlier than they said they were going to send it to me which that is great not lasting more then 1hr and lagging when you unplug the cable still working on this hope to up my rating if we can get things working first experience with the system was very positive issue is that on day two i saw a message in the lower right corner of the screen go to settings to activate windows settings says we cannot activate windows on this device because you do not have a valid digital license or product key if you think you have a valid license or key select troubleshoot below troubleshooter says something interrupted our troubleshooting called acer support and was told they would mail me windows installation usb memory stick waited a little over one week and asked for status update was told that usb install media was not available and i should contact microsoft for activation entered last four digits from activation error message and was told i would need a new product key contacted acer support again and was told we would need to return the computer to the factory for fix which could take 1520 business days plus shipping time briefly considered returning to amazon be decided to try the acer service option will be awhile before we get it back the physical device is very nice lighted keyboard good except no indicators for caps lock nor num lock that is unfortunate what acer saved 2 to not include two little leds bluetooth nonoperating out of the box so will need to troubleshoot touchpad stopped functioning after a few weeks another thing to troubleshoot hope that is all the bad stuff that happens to this new machine we got this as a grad gift for our grandson great price great laptop fast delivery flimsy returned it finally unboxed this laptop have not used much but the charger that came with it is not original making me think it is a refurbished laptop advertised as new or sent a used one will update this review when i have used it a bitif i do not return it it very light weight but not very fast screen quality it is good purchased this for a high school kid does what it needs to do the base model is ok i like that you can upgrade this in the future they included the bracket for a secondary drive i will be buying more of these for clients works well for school wish i had read i to description more no sd card or disc reader so cost was not as well as i thought after buying external readers windows does not run as smoothly on the acer as it did on my dell my games do not work as well have to refresh page often when searching on internet not happy with this product cannot complain about an acer product for the price and quality i live everything about it except the battery lifei constantly has to recharge it to appoint i just kept it plugged most of the time a good performance to summarize you get what you pay for i was not expecting to run into so many problems right when i took this out of the box1 immediately i heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when i pulled it out of its packaging2 the sound is so bad it is like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store the speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality3 loud fan when it gets a little warm when using4 scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs i had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos i noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs5 customer service from both acer and amazon makes it difficult to fix yourmy issues i contacted customer service the same day after i received this laptop and also the day after after telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed6 possible restocking fee wanting to return this item even though i barely used it the first 2 days customer service told me that i cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it before they can tell me whether or not i will be charged a restocking fee if you do not like being surprised by restocking fees do not buy this laptop so you will not have to return7 i was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem basically to spend more money just so i can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file8 screen quality is definitely not good i would give it a 610 the color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor the difference is super noticeable9 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me you would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you are basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usablei know this has good reviews but do not be fooled by it i was swayed when i was going through the reviews but after i got my product i was highly disappointed i wish i had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop this one is not worth the regular price i would say with the issues and quality of this laptop the price should be around 250 works fine sound could be louder i tried 3 of them they perform differently from each other and they appeared to have different hardware suppliers internal parts made by random manufacturers for example m2 port is only pcie x2 speed and advertised internal sata3 port performs about 300mb write and 500mb read on a drive rated 530mb write 550mb readover it looks as if it was put together in a hurry debris around plastic body can easily can cut hands skin etc this laptop is great and i had it for months but when i first got it i had to pay another 100 dollars to take s mode off of it the computer itself is great for basic use checking email browsing the internet writing papers etc i bought it because i have a macbook and most department of defense websites are not compatible with mac os my biggest complaint is that 1 month into owning it the charging cable does not seem to work anymore and i am terrified for the day that the battery dies and i have no way of charging it after that not good as described not hapoy with battery performance it is a great laptop sometimes it can act a bit uppity but just restart it if you just installed some apps also it comes on s mode which you can change to regular windows 10 for free go in settings application switch to windows 10 mode good laptop but ended returning found one better cheap laptop you get what you pay for no hard drive no cd player mouse board difficult to control the product key on the laptop was bad and so i could not activate it acer customer support was horrible told me if i had bought it directly from them they could have given me a new product key but since i bought it from amazon i am pretty much on my own last time i buy this brand machine is a really great budget machine i got it for my wife for school but more than just a throw away machine in the standard form it was nothing great adding more ram woke it up a lot better overall performancethe backlit keyboard is huge plus for working at night screen resolution and clarity is great as well i had to return my laptop after the mouse cursor had mysteriously quit working after 3 days of use while i am used toto apple products i tried troubleshooting my windows laptop even tried restarting in safe mode to troubleshoot without resolve i even performed windows recovery still no resolve confused i thought that is okay i am within the allotted time to return my laptop so i requested a return and opted for a new replacement vs refund i was careful to ensure i remained in compliance with the return policy as set out by amazon and followed the instructions stepbystep i downloaded the ra and ups label provided and used it to return my laptop as instructed the following day i checked the amazon website for status of my return only to discover that all information about my return mysteriously disappeared i did not think much of it as more than a temporary technical error as it was admittedly nearing the deadline for return having carefully followed instructions per amazons return policy and with my proof of shipment receipt from ups i was confident it would work itself out nope evidently not more than two weeks later no replacement no refund no response no communication and four to five text messages later to the seller via amazon website along w submission of my proof of shipment receipt and tracking still no record of initiation or tracking of my return the history of my messages to amazon seller and my return request are also poof gonewhat the no phone numbers just the runaroundapparently i am now out 500 and a laptop fabulousknow the risk this laptop is 14 i am soooo angry this laptop is great its affordable and have a bunch of cool features the only issue is that it is extremely low you definitely need a headset or speakers i have to lift the device to my ears to hear if i do not have any of these available i have had it for a year and so far so good i love it easy to work with screen is small whole computer is really a tiny bit larger than a notebook but the processor is fast and all i thought i was upgrading but i have to wear glasses when using this thing to see the letters i have ordered four acer laptops from amazon in the last two years and love each and every one of them i thought it would be nice buy a fifth acer laptop after reading all the positive reviews on this one they were wrong and very misleading i should have paid attention to the negative reviews they were accurate this acer laptop was the worst sound system was terrible you can barely hear it even if you turn it up to the max the mouse pad and keys were unresponsive cannot adjust the settings etc i used it for a total of thirty minutes 30 minutes after i charged it and i put it right back in the packaging i could not get it out of my house fast enough within an hour i called amazon for return authorization to pick up the laptop the following day i got my full refund amazons excellent customer service saved the day greatly disappointed by this acer laptop buyer beware consover heatsspeakers are horrible can barely hear videos had to install an additional app to make sound loudercomputer lags a bit should not lag for the price of it not recommend for the priceprosgood quality when watching videos etc i like everything about this computer except the volumeyou can barely hear anything on it dislike the teeny hddlike i can throw an external drive on it and am gtg after taking it out of s modenear perfect for my needs and decent price not touchscreen as was advertised in the question and answer section the graphics are so so worse than my last acer overall 4 stars good computer i am using it to create elearningwhen i tried to remove the computer from windows s mode i realized that the computer did not come with a product key what this means is in order to remove s mode you have to buy windows home or pro and use the product key to remove s mode i wish they would have just told me that i contacted the company via amazon chat they said i needed to contact the manufacturer they gave me a phone number there is a button on amazon to contact the manufacturer as well no successi ended up just buying the downloadable windows home version and used the product key to remove s mode i also purchased the microsoft software for powerpoint word excel etcthat is a lot of drama just to be able to download things to my computer just know that you are buying a bare bones computer when you purchase was a great computer until i had used it twice for zoom and now the speakers no longer work if i figure out why i will update when i first received this laptop everything seemed great i was very excited to set it up with my personal information and get going i very quickly realized however that this computer was extremely slow for my tastes even with no background programs simple tasks like opening file explorer or a web browser took far too much time in my opinion a brand new computer should be opening programs almost instantly not leaving me waiting a few seconds or more this is ultimately preference but i am sure there are many more laptops out there for a similar price point that would run much faster returned this after only a day or so of having it and ended up with another laptop from the early 2010s and it runs much better than this one i had this laptop for about 2 months now and i am loving it so far it is lightweight sleek and the backlit keys are great for me in my dark room it boots up in seconds ready to go when you turn it on i mostly use this for watching videos and streams and excels it that the only negative that i can think of is the placement of the speakers the speakers are placed on the bottom and really muffle the sound so my volume is always at max other than that the laptop is a great budget buy displeased some black looks more like green dotted lines are running down the middle of my screen looks like some kind of defect the laptop was purchased at the start of september and did not see usage until about the 25th of september which means in about two months this situation happened was satisfied with my purchase before this occurrence i am not sure if it has touch screen poor quality cheap just like the price laptop is unlikely to last you long charging port was junkon the positive side it is very light and smallif you choose to purchase this laptop best of luck to you the battery died after a week and the screen started blinking i needed to connect an external monitor to work bad bad bad i was told i was going to get a new battery sent to me because every since i have the laptop it will only turn on if it is plugged in to the wall and i never received a new one very cheesy one keep freezing not able open files or photos not going waste my time to fight that i love this laptop the screen is a great size it is light weight not heavy and very sleek good laptop i do not do anything out of the ordinary does what a laptop is made to do i stayed with acer because my previous laptop was acer if it did not lose the w key function i would still be using it but would buy a new battery because unless it is plugged in it randomly shuts down bad battery so the new laptop had a new surprise the sound volume is very poor now lugging a wifi speaker along wherever the laptop goes i have to not recommend for this very reason absolute garbage i really do not write reviews but when i do i usually make them for the people this laptop is good when it works but i only used this about 10 times and now it does not charge or turn on pretty much got robbed i am really disappointed i was really hyped about this product but no durability whatsoever no scratch or anything looks brand new and it is a lemon buyers beware acer aspire 5 slim laptop 156 inches full hd computer stop working this month july 2021 i purchase this item in october 2020 as a christmas gift for my grandson unfortunately the computer has stop working and the battery will not charge please contact me in reference to the warranty information i would not purchase another computer through amazon no customer service support when needed bought this for my brother laid up with back surgeryeasy to work great graphics and definitely user friendly all ok so far cute unitbut does not work after two hours black screen deadmay i have a replacement unit i love this computer but the mouse pad does not work had to buy a wireless mouse to even use it but otherwise great product good quality use it to work from home and meetings and classed i faced several issues with this pc in spite on light usage first google meet does not work on all browsers and suddenly mutes the conversation we spent ages trying to solve this problem until we discovered that it works only on microsoft edgesound quality is not clear and lowfinally the battery stopped charging and the laptop does not work except when it is plugged in power all of this happened after less than 8 months of usagea total waste of money the product arrived with a bad wireless card i returned the item and the refund was applied to a amazon gift card instead of my credit card i am not happy i have had this computer for a year and for some reason the computer will not work unless it is plugged in i originally got it for college but the pandemic caused me to stay and do school at home i have not spilled anything or dropped the computer so i do not know what the problem is nice pc but the backlighting went out after 3 weeks and acer could not help me having a laptop without being able to see the keys is not good bought one year ago already falling apart lacks durability good for a few months then you will need a new one the input to the power cord is broken and now the laptop will not charge the lever that opens and closes the laptop pulled apart stay away terrible quality i baught this laptop and after just a month and a half the mouse pad will not work scam all else ok i regret buying this laptop and spending all the extra money in shippingi am having two major troubles with this laptop1 the laptop slows down and lags badly once unplugged from power it runs fast and fine when plugged it is so bad i have gone to control panel and under power settings created a different profile for high performance and gone to advanced power settings and set everything to high performance and still the issue persistsi upgraded the ram to 16gb same issue i have done countless troubleshooting as seen on different websites my windows is updated i have switched off most background and startup apps and it is still same i just do not understand why i cannot have the freedom to use my laptop at high performance when unplugged this is crazy i am suspecting amd and acer to be behind this this issue sometimes does not happen but most times it does2 second issue is that when connected to hotspot this device will from time to time shut off internet connection for not obvious reasonso i could be in the middle of an important zoom meeting and off she goesdo not buy this if you want peace of mind the back cover also is inferior plastic considering i had a toshiba laptop for over 10 years with no problems i expected better of this but two months into it the touch pad and cursor died fortunately i still had the wireless mouse and keyboard so the laptop is still functionali do not have the time or patience to fool around with a return when i buy a product i expect it to work we will see how long it lasts track pad broke within 1 month of use amazon was no help extremely happy with this i have a laptop i can take on the go for long business trips even upgraded the ram to make it even better glad i found this</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I’ll admit I was very skeptical from reviews but I decided to purchase anyways…. and so far so good! Battery life is about 7 hours of constant use (games, videos, etc). Sounds is good. I had no problems connecting to internet. The border of the phone did appear to have some scratches but not too many., The phone I received has a loose charging port that should have been replaced. It was at 27% just now and I plugged it in and opened an app. Now it just gave me the under 20% notification so it’s obviously struggling to keep the cord in place., No working well can't download any apps horrible phone My old Android works better than this junk. Please refund money. Diana Manuele, It’s for personal and the battery life issues is crazy it’s only take 2 hours, Worked slow, barely charged., Battery life is not good at all. Only last an hour., The worse I never bought. Battery is dead and I sent it in Africa, so no way to return it. Just lost my money. I could give 0 star, I’m very picky with my phone cases which means I keep buying them until I find one that’s jut right. This phone case has everything I’m looking for. It’s not to bulky and has a slim fit. It’s enclosed and has a built in screen protector. The front plastic trim doesn’t cover top and bottom front of the Like some cases making the screen “appear” smaller.The rubber is stiff and durable and not like those cheap ones the stretch out over time.One reviewer stated they had to keep taking it apart to get the moister out. Well this is NOT a waterproof case and if it was it would be heavier and bulkier. I’m wondering how that much moister is getting in ther in the 1st place. Are you bathing with it? Tip: instead of drenching the phone with cleaning solution then wiping it up, try spraying the cleaning solution on the rag itself (just enough to coat it) then use that to clean the screen.Another reviewer stated the back falls off. If you don’t snap it in correctly this will happen. Solution: go to an arts and crafts store or fabric store and ask for some double sided hem tape. It’s very thin and extremely strong. It will keep that back on if it’s a defect., Phone broke a little after a month. Was only given a small % back on return and was never told why after multiple emails. Do not buy!!!!, Phone appeared to be flawless when it arrived. It stopped recognizing any sim card after 3 months. even though it was a few days out of warranty when it died the seller still took it back for a full refund., Too small in size, The phone looks great. However, the battery life was 70% instead of the promised 80%. This means that the battery dies very quickly, even when fully charged. We attempted to contact the seller but received no response. We would have settled for an exchange, but again, no response. Looks like we have to buy a battery, add another $50 to the price to get a fully refurbished phone. Very disappointed., Hey- it’s an iPhone. I did have to buy ear buds for this unit as none came with it.The phone is OK, but the battery is horrible., GSM does not work. This version of IPhone cannot be repaired. I stop being able to update, because it does not connect to the local network. It is WITHOUT SERVICE ... that is, now it helps me to connect only by wifi and to listen to music ... Battery drains from 100 to 0 in 2 hours of use  The battery is at 50%? I mean, impossible to use it. Lousy purchase They should withdraw it from circulation to these iPhone 7, Phone came in on 86 battery life and touch screen doesn’t like to work, wouldn’t recommend this phone., phone works great, but battery needs replacement, per the iPhone settings screen, just over 3 months after purchase. Does not hold charge for long even with all settings optimized, not using GPS in background etc. Otherwise price was reasonable., The phone battery was supposed to be at 80% or better but this battery only 77% and Apple saying need to replace battery now. It's too bad vendors don't install new batteries and increase the price because changing these batteries is not fun as you can have screen damage and broken wires. Aside from that very happy with phone and fast delivery., Good condition, but instantly overheats when charge. Not sure if that’s normal but the body of it great condition, This IPhone 7 gets really hot as soon as you charge it . Also it charges slow ,, The phone is unlocked no scratches , no flaws . Came right on clear. Packaged for fragile item very well. My daughter loves her new phone., It is hard to buy from a third party and it not working is frustrating., My review is half bad and half good. It came in almost a week, which I was crazy waiting for it. I was so happy when it got here! I checked the battery capacity and it only charges to 62, which was so disappointing. It charges really fast, but loses a lot of percent quick. Other than that everything was good. It came with a charger and charger block., I ordered from Trademore to get a refurbished iPhone 7, and it arrived fully ready to go out of the box with the latest iOS version installed. All I needed to do was add in my SIM chip and sign on with my Apple ID, and iCloud Backup restore did the rest. The unit I received works like new and was actually flat (as opposed to some other refurbs I've had); it had some scratching on the glass, but not over the actual display area. Trademore and Amazon refurbs may seemed more expensive than refurbs from elsewhere, but it's worth it for a great unit with no hassles or technical gotchas., It took a while for this to become an issue. At first I was restarting the phone which I thought was fixing the problem but the proximity sensor does not function properly. As a result, when I attempt to talk on a call, the screen remains lit and the side of my face continually hits the buttons, resulting in frustration for both me and the caller. It's impossible to hold a voice call at this point. Unfortunately, by the time I realized what the problem is, the phone isn't eligible for a refund., Easy to use, I got my iphone 7 opened it was fine owner didnt factor reset it i turned it on an it was on home screen.Works well i like it!! 8/10 😃, batter health was at 70 not the promised 80., Bad phones you are not honest, I bought this for a July gift.  It stopped working 8 months later.  It would no longer receive a cellular signal.  It took about a week to troubleshoot with the mobile carrier before they said it must be your phone.  I took it to a phone repair shop and they said the motherboard crashed. 😩, So I got this phone, when it originally came, it had more damage than what was listed so I returned it. The next one that came in had little to no damage so I was excited. However, after the 30 day return window (of course) the phone has been having all sorts of problems. I have audio issues with my phone on speaker, the keyboard gets stuck constantly, and the battery life is pretty much non-existent. Incredibly pissed I bought this for 230$ and now can only get 60$ if I sell it back. Just a warning, but if you buy your phone from here you are gambling with your money honestly. So just do a payment plan through your provider or get it from apple and spare yourself the frustration, Died every 20 minutes and constantly shut off and if it was colder than 50 degrees it would not turn on., I’m disappointed with this phone’s battery life. I have to make sure I keep a charger with me everywhere I go. This is my first experience with an iPhone so maybe that is how they are, I don’t know., This was in good condition and battery life good., Seller guarantees 80% battery. Received phone with battery capacity of only 75%. Seller never replied to follow up messages and only offered a $20 credit and never replied when alternatives were requested., Bought this refurbished iPhone for our daughter.  We like the parental controls that Apple offers.  We aren't going to buy her a new expensive phone so it is nice to get a used one from Amazon., Overall good product! The cameras kind of glitches at times but it overall works. The battery dies very quickly, but it works perfectly fine even without a sim card. Very good product!, I just got this  for my middle school son in time for school to start. It needed charging upon arrival, but the charging cord/plug that came with it did not work. Luckily this  is a replacement phone, and we have other chargers in the house and so were able to get it charged.It's working so far. I can't comment on battery life yet because it's too soon. The phone appeared to be in excellent condition., Overall satisfied with iPhone 7 transaction: the phone arrived in pristine physical condition--I could not find a scratch on it.The battery however had 78% capacity, not the 80% advertised. Not sure it would have made a difference as this phone was for my 12 year old son and in the end I decided to replace the battery (which granted is not for everyone as it's not a 5-minute process - more like an hour and 44 minutes process).Was able to successfully change the battery and all is well. So, net-net was able to get a like-new iPhone 7 for under $200.Recommend this vendor but do know if you are not comfortable swapping in a new battery you'll be charging your phone 2-3 times a day as normal phone usage will deplete the battery quickly., I like everything I don’t dislike nothing, Fine, I like is because it was a easy set up and everything was good on it, i have to go to apple because i got this phone for verizon and it wont let me make calls or texts sooooo basically dont buy it, I was pleasantly surprised after reading a few not-so-good reviews ... but the iphone 7 (Verizon) that I received looked like it was brand new.  It was packaged very nicely in a custom box with a new charging cable and AC converter.  Not a single scratch on it, \"battery health\" was rated at 84% and everything worked perfectly.  Frankly, I can't imagine why someone actually traded this in for a new phone????  But I'm glad they did.  My daughter (currently my Tech Support person) was sweet enough to get me a very nice \"Youmaker\" protector for it ... she knows I'm a bit clumsy.  I've only had this phone for a few weeks but so far so good.  I even use it for visual control (FPV) on a few of my quads/drones ... it is remarkable how well the battery holds up for that video on 10-15 minute flights ... much better than my old iphone.  Very glad I bought this., Runs slow , colabirtation is off and screen glitches, Battery life is insufficient and less than expected., Phone came fast and everything is good but the battery only holds a charge for about an hour when it’s not charging pretty annoyed about this., Bad battery life junk charger, just buy new instead of having to do it anyways, Home button non functional., Wasn't bad came in good condition., If I can fit everything I didn’t like about this phone into this box I would detail it.But whoever replaced the screen did a horrible jobWon’t register any SIM cards to any carrierIt looks like I bought it from wish.com, There’s a black line when trying to take pictures, takes horrible pictures, The phone is used and it doesn’t earphones, Everything was great. Like brand new!, Like many, read a lot of bad reviews... Was worried that there would be major issues upon getting the phone. HOWEVER, my phone showed up next day, SUPER FAST. Opened up the packaging and the iphone 7 looked very very good. Couple very tiny scuffs, but was expecting such as it is a USED phone would give it a 9/10 and i'm picky. Called my phone provider and they were able to switch it to my number no problem. I have sprint, which has merged with t mobile. I got the FULLY UNLOCKED phone, for anyone wondering. After running the phone through all its tests, everything is in proper working order. Battery life is at 84% which is fine by me. Higher than the stated number of 80% anyways. Never really payed attention to that stuff on the other phones i have had. All i can say is that the phone is doing everything it should and I am very happy with it. If there is one concern, the phone may be running a hair warm, but nothing to seem worried about momentarily. I will update this post at any point in the next 6 months if need be, but so far so good. COMPANY I WENT WITH: TECH EXCHANGEE NY, screen had a small crack and a chip  and the back has some marks on it and the home button is difficult to make contact. however the phone does work., Cord does not work!, This device only worked for 6 months and it started decaying. I send it to apple and they stated that it will need a new motherboard., This was for personal use the phone has been nothing but trouble since the day we got it. Will not make calls or will make calls on its own we don’t even when we’re not even trying. Need to know if there is insurance on this purchase Or is there any kind of warranty on this purchase, Item came without a charger, I have been using my phone for about a month, from what I have been able to assess so far the phone has been working properly, the battery holds fairly well, unless playing a game on the phone it drains the battery pretty quickly. The Siri function, the finger print unlock, and camera are pretty amazing, and they are some of the many things that I did not have on my iPhone 4...so this is a wonderful upgrade for me!, Very average product! Must have been used for couple of years before reselling it. Battery life was at 80% when arrived. Good purchase if one wants to buy iPhone at cheap price, Phone works great i have to say no problems so far 5/5, Have this phone just over six months it glitches, turns off all the time, battery drains fast, phone won't shut off even when the battery is at 98%.  The amount of money I spent on it I should have gotten more than 6 months use, wouldn't recommend., The phone  barley work can’t call nobody can’t text nobody, Why it dies so fast ?, It’s ok, It’s a good phone over all but often freezes or hangs up calls on its own. Dies very fast! Annoying., The stop working in 2 weeks, Extremely scratched and banged up. Shouldn't have passed quality control. Unless the standards are that low, Perfect condition, The battery on my other phone was only lasting me from 7 am - 1 pm so I figured I would get a new phone - The new phone is lasting from 7 am - 11am and says the battery is 100% healthy...., Worst purchase ever don't waste time on this item does not even turn on turns mad hot 1st day on arrival does not turn on 2nd day return hopefully all turn out good with money back update later on, Phone has no signal, Antenna broke internally on phone within 4 months just outside the 3 month return window.  Worked great until then., i liked it except for the fact that the back had some dints in it and u can’t turn it on silent mood, Look good, Speaker are not working, Arrived a day early which is usually nice, but I planned my schedule around it arriving on the estimated delivery date. It had obvious wear on the back and there was a small blotch on the screen that must've been dead pixels or something because it was pure white regardless of what was on the screen. I didn't like it in this condition, so I returned it and they said they would deduct return shipping cost from my refund but they ended up not doing that., The phone I received did not have a working microphone. Couldn’t record or make calls. The company issued me a full refund. They have great customer service but sold a faulty device so I gave a neutral rating., Honestly I was so nervous to buy a phone from Amazon for the 7 year old stepson ... but reviews can be very deceiving .. phone worked GREAT !! Now if I can only get this 7 year old to come back to earth and stay off the phone lol needles to say he loves it ..., The phone doesn’t work. I can hear a person I call, but they can’t hear me., I loved this phone for about a half a year and loved it! However, I got a message saying my SIM card could not be read. Turns out that this is a known iPhone mistake when iPhones are built. When I brought it to the Apple store they said that because it was originally made in Japan they could not fix it or send me a new one. I am now out for a new phone. However it worked very well when it did, I just wouldn’t risk it., My battery dies way too soon. The package also arrived much later than expected and also had a decent scratch in the screen deep enough to affect the overall appearance. The camera works just as expected but it definitely was not the “new” look you can definitely see the precious wear and tear on the iphone., No work for Verizon, Great phone thank you, i was confused by the packet  i received with item, it said iphone 5s - i was ready to return(im a new iphone user) i was kinda disappointed with charger not working - had to buy additional one to use phone - overall its a great item -, The phone was very nice looking phone, but I had to return the  phone due to it was not compatible with my sprint network service., The phone constantly restarts itself. The battery lasts all of 10 minutes. I do not recommend buying a phone from this company.. they’re junk., I've only had this Iphone 7 a few days. The reason I bought it is because my previous Iphone wouldn't hold a charge for more than a few hours. So far this Iphone will hold a charge for 2 days with moderate use. I'm happy with it so far. The charger that came with it did not work but I still have my previous Iphone charger that did work. Other than that I am happy with it. It didn't have any scratches or anything and looks brand new., This review is for the seller Hybrid IT. First of all, I wasn’t expecting it to come as fast as it did. I ordered my phone Friday at 3 AM and received it Saturday by 12 PM, that’s kind of insane since they are in NY and i’m in FL. There are a few small scuffs on the bottom of the device near the speaker but otherwise it’s pretty close to perfect cosmetically. The screen has no scratches at all, i can’t tell if it’s the original but if it was replaced they did a hell of a job. The max battery capacity is 100%. it came with a charger but no headphones or headphone adapter so you will need to buy one. i haven’t experienced any issues so far but it’s only been a day so i will make sure to come back and give an update.Also if you have Metro by TMobile and you’re having trouble getting service after inserting your SIM, you have to register the phone with them before it will work, not sure about other carriers. for a second i thought i received a locked/stolen phone but i wanted to make sure. don’t give up unless the carrier actually tells you it won’t work. you can try calling the customer service number and doing it with the automated system or a representative but if you don’t have access to your old phone you need to go into the store. It took 5 minutes and only costs $15-20 depending on where you live.Overall i’m extremely pleased, it was a risk but i’m happy i seem to have gotten a good device. Thankful for all the reviews recommending to buy from this seller., The maximum capacity of the battery was on 74% when I received the phone. I can only use the phone for a few hours before the battery is completely dead. Other than them sending it with a bad battery the phone works great., DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!! I got this in today after looking for a good phone for my son for about 2 months the home button didn't work and you can't use Verizon it is not Amazon renewed its a scam, Phone is ok, no marks or scratches, but came with outdated ios that needed to be updated prior to transferring data from old phone.  Battery life isn't great., There are times when a phone is set to support another carrier, and even after a full factory reset, any carrier update will kill your mobile network.  Happened to me.  Sprint/T-mobile reset it and tried multiple times, and every time we got it to work, it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a day.That means no calls, no text, no internet if you're outside of wifi.Be warned and keep your old phone handy.  You may be disappointed like i was., Every renewed phone I’ve gotten before this one had a renewed battery. This one did not. Will have to get one soon, phone charge only last a few hours. Would not have bought it if I would have known the battery was not renewed., ok, It was good phone till a month after purchase kinda salty about it still wish i didnt spend on the phone also did not come with the right charger, I like the condition of the phone. It really looks as good as new.The problem is on the earphones plug. Should provide the adapter., The phone was ok. I had a few issues but nothing major., Gof a great product. Fast response, Phone worked great for about 6 months. Then it stopped connecting to the cellular service. Trying to update it and the phone says that I can’t. Called Apple support and they can’t do anything since phone is no longer under warranty., Everything was good except the battery came to me at 80% capacity.  So when it charges to 💯 it’s never better than 80%.  The seller offered me a 20.00 credit but I can’t find an authorized dealer to change the battery.  🤷‍♀️, This phone is almost perfect!!! The only thing about this device is that I can’t get it turned on due to the fact that it won’t accept a SIM card. I found this misleading due to the fact that they told me my device was renewed and compatible with certain carriers., Nice piece, My son loves it. Arrived quick, looks new, & works great! He’s been smiling since, Received the phone in the usual blank white box refurbs come in, shipping was fast and it came with an android charger block and a no name lightning cable.Phone came with one long deep scratch, a cracked home button, and a couple other much smaller nicks and scratches, enough that it was off putting for me. Battery life showed 92% which is excellent however the phone did seem to lag after only my second week with it.Phone was unlocked as stated and I had no issues switching in my sim and using the phone right away. Overall a decent phone but I will be returning it because of the the cracked Touch ID button and deep scratches, The phone does not work properly it heats up so hot every time we try and use it ., Gift good condtion, A good way to get a new iPhone at a good price, The battery is useless, it takes 3 hours of use to fully recharge, needs to be replaced, All seemed as expected from the seller and from description except battery life was not 80% or above as stated in listing but 70%.The biggest issue with this was having to pay, send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promised.This just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending, then what else are they not checking with these phones., Didn’t come with any kind of paperwork and it’s working but the touchscreen can freeze up at times., Although i was very happy to get a much needed upgrade from my old 5s and this was just the right size there were a couple of things i was not satisfied with and almost sent the phone back. First of all Amazon stated the battery would be able to be charged at a minimum of 80% its original capacity mine was not it was around 75% i figured ok well i suppose i could live with that but amazon also states that there will be no visible blemishes on the phone viewed from 12 inches that was not the case with mine the finish on one of the rear corners about a half inch the entire corner of the phone was completely wore off once again i decided I could live with that since it is the rear and would be covered with the case. Overall im happy with the speed and functionality of the phone though and the screen camera and everything work great. I’m not happy that i will end up putting another 50 to 100 dollars into a phone that cost me about 200 in order to get a new full capacity battery that lasts longer for media and extended use, Daughter loves it, No fingerprints reader and the phone Glitches a lot, I was switching phones because the one I was using had a battery that was starting to die. However this one does just as quickly and got so hot it almost hurt to hold it., I just opened this product and charged it fully for two hours and unplugged it. As I’m sitting here on my old phone to port over my SIM card credentials, the battery went from 100 to 88% within 8 minutes. I just saw the numbers dropping right before my eyes. The phone transfer and condition are really good but the battery is terrible. I wish the guarantee included a new battery. (Health is reading at 83% out of the box)., The phone is very small., BATTERY LIFE NOT AS ADVERTISED  ONLY 56%NO ANSWER FROM SELLER, The phone looked good function well but was defective it had something loose inside and I had return it, I’d definitely buy again. This the real deal fr. Y’all should try them out! I got my money’s worth ., The battery life last about 2 to 3 hours., Great phone, defiantly recommend. It’s a little weird at times like it takes a while to turn on after it dies sometimes and I can’t have certain pictures as my screensaver for some reason. It would black out parts of it but I only had that problem with two of my pictures. Other than that for a refurbished phone it’s pretty good., I've boughten iPhones from amazon before, two different iPhone 6s. This time, I could only find iPhone 7, so if figured \"why not?\". I'll tell you why, this seller sent a defective phone. It worked perfectly the first day, and then 24 hours later it told me I needed to update it or else my cellular data wouldn't work (which means I could not receive or send any texts or calls!). Sure enough, I updated it, and it worked, for another few hours, until it said it needed ANOTHER UPDATE! Unfortunately, it was already up to date as it could be. So I took it in to the \"geniuses\" at APPLE, and they said THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH iPhone 7, YOU NEED TO REPLACE IT. And that was it. Returning, hopefully that goes smoothly. Avoid iPhone 7, too sketchy., excellent product   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 It’s thick, but works good once you get used to it!, These base and top coats work great for an at home gel mani-pedi. My only issue was when i tried to soak and scrape it off, it seemed like the base layer bonded almost TOO well with my nail, and part of my nail layers scraped off. I had to take a few months break between the next gel manicure because my nails were damaged. This could just be user error or the fact that my nails are extremely thin. They held up great though, and looked beautiful., the product works great, the only reason i didn’t give five stars was because it smells TERRIBLE. like a skunk almost and it’s very strong. but it works, and works well., I would buy it again. Beats having to use nail polish remover in the end. Best quality I’ve ever used at home. Nails come out looking professional. Very easy to use. I recommend it., smells awful, While the polish is great, every bottle I've ever had from them, 4, ALL HAVE LEAKED when on their side., I love this product it’s very easy and it last for 14 days, Best brand for top coat and base!! My favorite one, Terrible product. The base coat seemed to work fine, but the top coat was in such a gel-like consistency that I couldn't even use it. No matter how hard I shook the bottle up, it remained the same. Waste of money. Only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the base coat worked. All in all, NOT HAPPY!!!, The base coat is horrible. You’re better off just buying the top coat only. Top coat is average I would say. I’ve done my manicures without the base and they come out better. The base causes the polish to look bumpy., Really cool that I can do this at home. Just light and done!, My top coat bottle came completely empty. I am returning for a replacement but it’s disappointing!, Poor quality, was only good the first few uses. Base coat became thick and does not go on smoothly at all. Product quality changes over very short time. Would not recommend. Both me and my sister are allergic to this product. After some use it causes nail bed pain and inflammation., It's great that you take a picture... but it helps if you show the door # !!! This was dropped off at 104!? NOT 106, I could not get the base coat to dry fully.  I used my UV light 5 times (5 min) and it was still tacky.  I gave up and went ahead and put polish over it anyway.  The polish I used thankfully was able to dry just fine.  The top coat seemed to dry much better but I won't be using this brand again., Overall this is a good set. It can be thick so be sure to wipe the brush on the side of the bottle before applying and when covering your nail. Make sure to use thinner coats and apply evenly or else you’ll see the lines/uneven levels after curing.For curing times, I have a UV LED lamp and wasn’t sure how long to cure for. Top coat 60 seconds is perfect. Cures hard and comes off easily when time to remove. For base coat I tried 60 seconds but was having a hard time when removing it, so I went down to 30 seconds and that seems to have helped., Top coat dried out in the bottle after 3 uses. Returned!, Perfect, Bottles came leaking from the top. The gel polish I got to go along with these two bottles was perfectly fine and intact. Why these leaked I don’t know. I haven’t used them yet either since most of the product was all over the box it came in., Top coat goes on nicely and leaves a nice shinny coat and is not sticky., Pretty easy to come because the polish came off within a week. I would have expected it to last at least 2 weeks., Very small but not too bad, Nice, not that good, This product worked amazingly well. After a minute under LED /UV it was dry. Very sheer and worked well with my polygel kit., First time trying this brand and my last. Very, very thin like a refusal polish, not hard at all. Nails broke easily. I do not recommend this brand., Great product, Amazing! Lasts the longest out of anything I’ve tried!, This is a peel off formula. I do follow all the instructions for application and I never use acetone to remove. I soak in water for a few minutes or just hand wash some dishes and I am able to peel of the polish most times I one piece. Now while that its awesome because it removes easily, the manicure does not last past 2 days with out major chipping., I used it the first time and it worked real good! but the second time was horrible, I could not get it to set correctly, it was in a way clumpy? it sucks because I really wanted to like it., Horrible product. Does not stay on. The top coat has a thick glue like consistency and does not spread on nail well. Peels off within a couple of days. So disappointed., Is just a oil, It is clumpy and didn’t even dry all the way through, now my nails are smudged.Está muy gruesa y no se secaron bien mis uñas., I ordered the base & top coat about 4 years ago & I loved it. I started doing my own nails again so I wanted to try it again...bad idea. The base coat works fine but the top coat started clumping & was too thick & this was only the first use. Maybe they’ve changed the polish since the last time I used it but I won’t be ordering it again., Works fine doesn’t last too long though., The base coat good, but the top coat is trash! Starts peeling the next day., Great base and tip coat!! Lasts atleast 3 weeks for me!!, Not even an Ounce, I have tried various steps in an effort to get this polish to last longer than 7 days. It doesn't matter what I do it chips and looks like crap and has to be changed by day 7. I bought this base and top with Amelie gel polish., The topcoat got extremely clumpy after the second use causing an unsmooth finish., I was super excited to get my gel polishes in with such fantastic ratings- unfortunately the product was so thick when i went to apply, it applied like a literal paste.  There is no good use for this polish and I would like a refund promptly., I love the no wipe too coat. Saves me some time., This brand doesn’t hold up, the shellac peels off a lot sooner then expected., seriously soooo good! i do my own gel nails/toes at home and this is by far the best set i’ve gotten. gel polish is definitely an art and takes a long time to master - if this set “lifts” you probably just aren’t doing your gel application correctly. these two are excellent! also added bonus you don’t need to wipe the top coat :), The item itself is good but the bottles are very very tiny. I wish they made them a little bigger for the price., This does what it says it will do and the top coat is not sticky at all when it sets. The only complaint I have is that if you try to close the bottle when there is polish on the brush and the polish gets onto the mouth of the bottle, the cap will actually shrink wrap onto the mouth of the bottle making it very hard to open! This has happened to me several times so now I make sure there is no polish on the outside of the mouth of the bottle and I try to close it very gently not tightly. Please be aware of how you close this nail polish otherwise it will take FOREVER TO OPEN when you want to use it again., I really loved this product for the first few months! But recently began to have an allergic reaction to the product! I'm bummed I have to switch it up now because its great quality. Not saying don't buy it-- but definitely be mindful!, Very good product. Will buy again., applies and cures well, but dulls your manicure significantly. Also the base coat is difficult to remove., Bought for my sister who does nails and she didn’t like it... sadly, I like the product it’s a good shine and it lasts about two weeks I was pleased., The gel has a murky purple coating during the day time. It glows green under UV light.  When comparing this top coat to my Kupa inc Top coat there is a huge difference in color. Kupa inc top coat is clear and the Aimeli has the Murky Purple coating., So in love with this gel. It is thick and gets into all the nooks and crannies. It was actually recommended by a nail tech on you tube (nailed by nikki) and I had to try.  So far I am loving this product!!! If you don't like thick gel this is not for you but trudt you won't regret this buy., Top coat does not wear well. Base coat works great!, Dislike, Great base and top coat for gel nails, Not bad I've ordered it several times wish they would sell a matte top gel with these too, I was scared at first because it Was still tacky after curing under UV light but I read it’s supposed to be so polish will stick. Continued with my nail routine and it turned out well! Really great product especially for the price!!, Great for beginners. Works well, I brought the polish the size of the bottle for what you pay is pretty small I don’t blink your eyes, This chips and peels off, about like regular nail polish.  It is nothing like \"gel nails\" that you get in the salon, which is what I was looking for., Top coat turns yellow after a few days. I have used the base and top coat 4 times so far, and every time my nails start turning yellow after a few days. I have tried different curing times and even wiped the top coat after, but nothing seems to fix it. This has never happened with other brands of gel top coat I have used., Worked pretty good, good product for the price ! I usually get opi but this did the job, This was great for the price. Only issue was it did chip in some nails but that may have been true to operator error, I may not have cured the polish long enough. All in all I’m happy with my purchase. Also, arrived a lot sooner than I had anticipated., This! I can’t even begin! This is an amazing base and top coat my nails lasted! It was easy to use, and great for gels!I love it, This is my first gel base and top coat so I really don't have anything to compare it to., This must be a cheaper brand or the base coat is just bad. I have been using file off gel polish and I was noticing that I have a problem not damaging my nail when filing it off. It wasn't killing my nails, but I figured soak off would case me to do less accidental damage.I bought this brand because it was prime available and somewhat inexpensive. In a week I have had two nails (one on each hand) peel completely off. Its not like the free edge got loose. It just was really lifted in the middle or edge where it frowns in, and the loose polish would get peeled up to an awkward place where I had to remove it or it would peel even more off the top layer of my nails. One happened in just 3 days. THREE DAYS. I fixed those two jankity nails and I also added a second coat of just the top coat to all of my nails after 1 week. I can't tell if the top coat is better or not.Now this does have a perk. Its super easy to soak off and remove. Like wow it removes like butter. But, if its coming off super easy because it falls off of a well prepped nail in less than a week, this is a problem. I can now see why this has some lower ratings and why people would spend at least double on a widely known US name brand. Will I use the rest of teh bottle? Yes. I am cheap! I also like changing my nail polish color frequently if I can pull that off. This soaks off so easy that I could totally change my polish all the time. But, it also just falls off which means when I am too busy to do a manicure once a week this just flat out sucks.Edit: I have updated this review because after sitting and soaking off the polish I am really happy with how my nails look. They aren't damaged or sad looking. It really did just bubble up and off. This wouldn't be my choice for wearing before going on vacation or trying to wear for weeks in a row since it doesn't bubble up and come off easily, but if you like to change your nail color a couple of times a week you will be happy with this polish.8/8 Update: I keep trying this base/top coat FOOLISHLY because I have it. It keeps performing poorly. Polish just pops off within a day or two of application.  Just spend more and get Gelish. Even with shrinkage at least it stays on the nail better. Its my own fault for trying it again, but good grief., Peels easy, This basecoat is whack. Upon applying it, it’s separated like crazy. When I applied my gel color over top it also would separate on top until the second or third layer when it evened out. The topcoat is great, not tacky once it’s been cured and works as advertised., Top coat and base coat is very thick hard to apply thin.  Took forever to cure and was sticky had to put under the led light a lot longer than suggested to cure and then my thumb completely peeled off, This is the worst gel I've ever used. Doesnt really fully harden.  Peels off. Not durable at all. Do not reccommend!!, Not good dont buy this, This item is a great price for the two bottles. And it a product that I like because of the no wipe top coat, and it give a nice shiny finish., Easy to use and has a nice longevity! Impressed with the quality., Not so well, I used this base and top coat with the Gellen polish brand. This stuff works great- top coat is very glossy and dries fast with the UV lamp. Like instantly dry. I’ve had these nails for 2 weeks and the gloss wore off a smidge but that’s expected after 2 weeks. Still hasn’t chipped or lost ALL glossiness. I recommended this brand to 2 friends. Overall great purchase! I will be buying the colors next., I am reasonably new to gel nails and this was my first set of top and base, which I bought as Amazon reccommended it. I am fully aware of how long it takes to remove gel, but this stuff DOES NOT COME OFF. An hour of working at it every manicure with sandpaper, bowls of acetone, and wraps, and it just does not budge. Yet, it manages to lift along my cuticle line after a week and a half. Buy something higher quality and experiment with inexpensive gel colors. Lesson learned., I do like this but do not get to close to the sides of your nail. It will peel up. I can get it to last 7 to 10 days so I guess it's not to bad. Its not easy to take off unless it is peeling up. I am by no means a pro with my nails so it could totally be something that I am doing wrong but for the price it's not a bad product., Great quality for the price. Convenient that you don’t have to use rubbing alcohol after use. My nails stay on really well using the base and top coat. Used with uv light., look nice but the nail polish only last like 4 days., Liked this product and the cost is fair. I have used name brands that have cost more and this brand is equivalent., Bottles were broken at the cap. Bottles spilled out the contents. Was not able to be used. Very disappointed, This is my favorite base & top coat set. I definitely wish that they made bigger bottles or maybe a refill bottle because I literally have to order a new set every week. I go through them too quickly and having the option to just refill my bottle would be so amazing., I really like this base/ top coat but it does leave almost a blue tint to the polish sometimes or it can be streaky., I am new to the DIY UV lamp. This is a must have for UV gel! Make sure your nails are clean and dry before you put the base coat (wiping with alcohol works well). Would recommend and buy again, Not a big fan of this. The base coat never dries (which I know is kind of okay cause it's a base coat) but overall it just takes forever under the lamp. And by that time things like dust get stuck in the polish so it's weird., Was old, Really smooth and shiny but it has a really strong smell, Bought for a friend and she said it's the best she's used this far. I'll stick to the Beetles brand but it's good to know there's an alternative that works well if necessary., good, This top coat sucks. It gets so cloudy and it doesn’t shine, I bought this as my first gel base and top coat. Polish lasted the average two week which was great. However, no matter how careful I applied it, it always left imperfections. Like it shrinks when it sets up under the light. Perfect and smooth going on. Ripples when dried. I tried it with many different colors/brands and always got the same result. I will stick to my new favorite CNC Shellac. Perfect every time, Used it twice. By the second time, the product had already become a useless gooey substance.Waste of money., I work whole day and full time mom and this works great lasts 10 days!, Easy to apply, Received today and not sure if this is oldProduct but I can’t get the top coat bottle open not sure but it’s definitely defective, You NEED the no wipe top for any of their polishes., I use plenty top coat but this is the worst by far, Works great., Pretty nice polish., After using this product as instructed I realized that the topcoat comes off way too easy. I am not happy with it. I do like the builder gel but other than that I do not like this product, My base coat takes a longer time to dry other than that will by again, Love the colors but peels off ez on natural nails, This set is really nice and works well for acrylic nails. Be warned that on natural nails the top coat burns when cured. Otherwise this product is awesome., Trash !!, I love the base and top coat the only problem I’ve had is that the top coat came really lumpy but I’ve been working through it and just wiping the clumps off as I work. But over all they’re both great and last., i love how it goes on----i got so excited i ordered more----but it chips after a few days---am so very disappointed in that---would not buy again----now that i already have!!!, bought it as a result of all them better tthan positive reviews, i was not at all disappointed! definitely recommended with no reservations!, Long lasting, but a few cons. The product is very runny so you have to be careful, otherwise you'll have a lot of clean up around your cuticles to do before curing. I didn't have issues with peeling or chipping until a couple weeks later, so that's a plus. The biggest con for me was the removal. I'm not sure this is really \"soak off\". I soak cotton balls in 100% pure acetone and wrap in foil. After 40 minutes, only the top coat budged.... A little. My gel polish, another brand, peeled off very easily, but underneath the base coat was hard as a rock. This is the same thing that happens when I use my regular gel polish top coat and forget that it has to filed off and accidentally soak them., I love a good base and top coat but I do not want it to be so thick. This product is much thicker than any I have used so far and I had a lot of bubbling on my nail and for these reasons I am passing on future purchases., I've been using these for years. Seems like the formula changed lately. Less shiny, doesn't have the same look under the LED light. Not sure how it will hold up., Top coat was clumpy. Purchased 2 x happened to both top coats, The top coat was not going on well.  I had to replace the top coat with a different brand but I still use the base coat, The base coat works quite well (difficult to remove it though), but after 1 or 2 uses the top coat doesn’t work very well at all. It bubbles like crazy leaving a polka dot texture,  and my nails start chipping after 4 or 5 days of wear. Would not recommend., Functionally decent. They smell atrocious though, more so than any nail product I've smelled in my life. Acrylic smells better than this stuff, it's like burning plastic straight from the bottle. Needs over 60 seconds under UV to set but that's not a huge deal., I don’t know what I’ve been doing wrong, if anything, but the base coat cures in a weird way. It will almost bubble and shrink to one side of my nail. I thought it was my technique or lamp, but I later found out it wasn’t the case. The top coat is pretty solid though, so I’ll keep using that., I was so excited about finding a cheaper alternative to the Sally Hansen brand - but the first time I stuck my hands in any water, the top coat chipped right off and looked awful. Also took a long time to cure., It's cheap, but you should probably just pay a bit more for a better top coat., Nice gel. As expected., Applies well, dries well with my lamp, is no wipe. My only complaint is that it doesn't get thick or strong enough., This product works for maybe a day or 2 but after that it peels off or chips easily. So with that being said it definitely easy to remove lol. Would recommend just spending the money on a better product that might cost more. You will save yourself time!, I've had these for some time now. I do prefer this formula over other brands, HOWEVER, after using for a while, the outside of the bottles gets extremely sticky. There is still plenty of polish left over in the bottle, so I hate to throw it away, but I might have to replace them because I can't stand the feeling. Other than that, everything is great. Just make sure that you keep them upright all the time and be careful when using., This is amazing product., Love this product works great cures in 30secs. Would recommend 2 anyone who wants stronger lasting 💅 nails, Polish started chipping on day 1. To be fair, it may have been the UV lamp I was using because I think it was defective; hence the extra 2 stars., I love that you don't have to wipe the topcoat, but no matter how long I soak my nails… The basecoat will not come off! I have excellent soak off fingernail  polish remover, But the basecoat will not come off  all of the way . I'm going to have to sand it off my nails., Wow! This stuff lasts a very long time, however it took me 3 separate times of soaking my nails with acetone to remove the top coat at 20 minutes each time. I buffed my nails first to scratch it too. It might be easier to let the polish grow out! The top coat polish keeps its shine for entire time. This stuff lasts a long time.The base coat didn't even come off, so I just buffed it off with my nail file.I want to give this a great review, the price is so good, it's just so darn hard to remove. I like the other polish colors, but just will use my other brand base and top coats instead., Polish was awful, it was thick and difficult to apply because it didn’t flow from the brush...it globbed. I did use the curing light-thinking it might kind of smooth out a bit??  and it took 4-5 mins  (supposed to take ONE minute!!)  to make it “seem” ok but it never did completely dry. HUGE waste of my money and my time, The top coat is amazing! I love it. The base coat is weird (minus a star).  You have to put a super EVEN coat on the whole nail and it can’t be too thin of a layer because it becomes uneven. You have to use just the right amount. Anyway, it makes me wonder if the base coat is even necessary. Also, the base coat doesn’t dry hard after the lamp. It’s a bit sticky so don’t touch it. That’s supposedly normal though., I have mixed feelings about this product. The first time I  used the polish it was amazing!! But the next time I used it it was like the top coat was setting/hardening on the brush. I pulled that clump off and then went on it worked just as the first time. But then when I go to use it the 3rd time there is little hard pieces all over the brush. The was no sticky film once you cure it under the light. I just wish I for more uses out of it rather than looking like 3... I've used many gel polishes but this is the first to do this. I may have gotten a bad batch or something. I really like the base coat I have had no problem with the my polish coming off of my nail., Sticky, very sticky, I don’t feel like it is quite as shiney  as previous ones I have purchased, Pretty good.  Once dry there are no problems with chipping or peeling.  But need to take extra time under the UV lamp.  I've used two different brand lamps and both take a while to dry.  So, be patient and you have a great polish., I've used several different base and top coats but when I used this one it started peeling off after 3 days. Nice shine but that's a bummer., Doesnt stay on., Really shiny, easy to use, but for some reasons, it turns yellow after a couple days (3-4)., I've been sandwhiching my my old polish with great success. Lasts over a week, I haven't waited for it to chip to remove.I don't notice any funky smell like other reviewers.I have to say though, the base coat is difficult to remove. I have to do a second round of buffing and soaking to get it off, and still have to buff of the remnants.PS. You have to let your nail polish dry before you put on the top coat or it will never dry!, Will buy again, Leaked everywhere. Such a mess. Had to throwaway., VERY disappointed in this product. I have used a better top and base coat in the past and repurchased those instead. I missed the cut off to return it, but I honestly would. It didn’t last more than a week!, This base coat was unbelievably bad.  It applied smoothly (to freshly washed & cleaned nails that had been wiped clean of residue with alcohol), then as it cured it drew together into raised rivulets, leaving other parts of the nails completely bare. It also went spiky, with little points all over it that gave it a texture like there was sand mixed in. Needless to say, this did not provide a smooth canvas for my manicure, and when two coats of gel polish over it still couldn’t completely smooth it out, my only choice was to put a glitter overcoat over everything to camouflage it. So unimpressed!, Love ,love ,love. Very easy to apply and the topcoat is amazing. Week 3 and no chips on my nails. I have tried many other products,  but this is the BEST.  Highly recommend., TerribleQuality, make sure you are sober when you put it on the first. it's more difficult than regular polish, but it is 100% worth it,  very great colors and it last a lot longer., Base is not good. Top coat does cure pretty quickly but they really don't help the gel stay on longer as my gel chipped the next day. Was pretty annoyed at that., Good quality, very shiny but to little of product, I am glad I bought these but the top coat has been leaking a bit out of the top so it won’t last as long as I’d like but I still am pretty glad I bought it! And the price isn’t bad either!, I love this brand these are amazing, Unlike some name brand's, this product is too soft and allows your nails to tear. And peels off way too easy., It's ok I trying better that keep your nail polish on. More two day sad I have to do my nails very two days cause of product isn't good. Not worth the money., Excellent base & top coat. Makes my nails really shiny and hard and my polish last for 2+ weeks. But it does seem to dent if you push your nail or something sharp into it and for that I’m removing one start. Removal is easy too with a 180 grit file., I gave it 2 star's because the base coat get hard at all so I order a different kind I hope it works better, Bad quality, I use gel polish that does not require a base coat, so I only use the top coat. It dries down nice and hard and does not have a sticky finish. My biggest complaint is that the top coat almost separates, and does not provide an even finish. Does the job, for the most part.   \n",

                                                                                                                                 I was not impressed with the image quality.  Also the app that was suggested to use my phone as a remote for it did not work properly., Biggest pain to attach to a helmet. But works well otherwise., the only thing about the camera was that i had no clue it was so small., We enjoy using this camera to get a canine view of our dogs' activities! It fits well into their harness and we get to see them running, swimming, and playing. There are a large number of function and features, so reading the instructions is a must, especially to take full advantage of the power of this camera. It holds up well to use, we've had no problems with it in several months. Would definitely purchase again!, Not a good purchase, This camera works as advertised and video quality is more than I expected. Great features for the price. The adhesive in some of the mounts could be better. I wish they had special mount for ski helmets., This is a 12 megapixel camera with 4K video. Waterproof case is good and numerous attachments for mounts are included. Photo quality is less than average compared to my iPhone 6s and I can not get videos to play at all. Overall I would spend a few extra dollars and buy a better platform to capture life with., I bought this as a gift for my son, we haven't had a chance to use it just yet. The only issue I've had was inserting the SD memory card. Something seemed to be wrong with the slot. It wouldn't stay inserted all the way in, it seemed it was engaged like it already had a card in the slot. After some time I did manage to get it in correctly. We did do a practice video and took a picture, it has nice quality. We cant wait until the weather warms more to try it out., Bought this for my 9 year old son several months ago. It has been great. Glad we bought it. High quality for the reasonable price and a tough little camera.  It’s holding up well! No negatives I can think of. Works well with phone app. Glad I didn’t spend the extra money for GP. No need. This thing does it all. Lots of videos on YouTube comparing the two. See for yourself., Does not always stay on.I use it as a dash camera., The WIFI system sucks on this camera and the app it requires you to use keep crashing. I found another use for the camera but I would never by this camera again., I love this camera, works wonders for dirt bike trail riding and capturing sea life under water!, Product shipped fast, seems like a great camera so far just recently started using so not sure how to rate long term  yet., Audio doesn't pick up well in the protective case but the video is great. We're still learning to use it but the grandkids have fun recording things., I got this for my husband for a gift, the app didn't seem to work well with his Motorola phone, sinking issues and gave up on it. He has recently uodated to a new Samsung Galaxy 10, so hopefully will be able to get it to work w/it., Good price but takes terrible videos. It’s not worth the time to even save these videos. Look at the videos on the feedback, I don’t know why people think this is a good camera. Don’t waste your time., Very difficult to figure out what parts go to what and what they are used for. If you give them a good review they’ll give you another accessory that you’ll have no idea how to use. NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL INCLUDED. I guess you get what you pay for. I should have checked YouTube before purchasing this. Got it today, returning tomorrow., So far I'm impressed with this product. One things for sure no matter what u plan on mounting it to there's an accessory included to do so. I've only had it for a day but so far so good., doesn’t upload to your computer. Hard to work, This little cam is really good i went to the Bahamas last week and took many under water videos and photos and this camera work like a dream just remember to put in a high speed micro SD card (not included)., I absolutely love this and i have recommended it to all of my friends. I would definitely purchase this again. Thank you, No way that this is 12MP. No. Way! Also (and this was the main reason why I returned it)), the batteries lasted less than half an hour on a full charge. And, for some reason, the only way I could have turned on the camera was if I removed the battery from its compartment and re-insert it., Product works very well.  I use it for fishing and nature hikes. Taking videos hands free is a big advantage. I was impressed with all of the attachment accessories.Excellent value., While the picture is great, it appears that you have to set the date and time every time you change the battery. I haven't found anything in the manual that will save the date and time permanently which is unacceptable. Well I just found it #11. It says \"if you replace the battery, date and time will reset\". WT???????, Disappointing didn’t even work for 30mins in the water and stop working. Don’t waste your money!!!, UPDATED review:(SUPPORT to the Win) After seeing this review, the manufacturer emailed me back, and sent me 2 new batteries no charge, and both were timed by filming a clock, (lol) and both did about 2hrs of run time, of course i ran this once on each. Once summer comes i will pull out the helmet cam and go riding and push the camera to the limit. Advice, be sure to keep the camera outside of the waterpoof case if your riding in the heat, it gets hot with those batteries. Thanks Akaso for the follow upOriginal Review:I purchased this for my mtn bike rides and well it works nice but if you like having to try and time yourself on the trail and at 20 min per battery and only have 2 batteries than well, go for it, its a nice toy. Otherwise ya pay for what you get., The quality of the camera is about what you would expect for $60. It works exceptionally well in brightly lit areas like the outdoors and it also has a wide variety of attachments that make it great for whatever activity you plan on documenting such as hiking, water sports or skating.It's a great entry camera for people who are interested in getting involved with filmography., So I bought this item last year for a Xmas gift, and we are now just being able to use it. And the cord doesn't charge the battery, Works great for its price as well as wrist watch works with Simonides cameras as well great product great battery life, Lots of ways to use this camera. Ordered this thinking it would b great to b able to video our hunting dogs.  We were surprise at all the features it offered.  Must download the instructions and read carefully in order to get the best use from camera., Gave to grandchild.  Loves to show what he does., Wouldn't work for half my trip bought a memory card for it that was ment for the device, kept saying card in valid,battery's lasted about an 1hr, Have not had a chance to give a performance test of it. The box ship in was way to small for the item and it could have (lucky it did not) get damaged. So right now only can say packaging was not good. Will see later this week if camera is any good., It seems like a good camera. I have only used it in the pool so far.  I won't do scuba diving with it until June.The instructins are VERY lacking so it makes it much harder to figure out how to use.Also, I thought it had WAY to many extra parts that I will NEVER use., Very very, complicated. It will take a while to figure out., After opening the box and trying to figure it all out with no so hot directions and diagrams, I gave up and gave it to a friend's son who has more experience with the tech.  So many pieces and it was just not worth it for me.  I never even got it working so I can't judge the camera at all.  So, if you are into high tech camera stuff, it might be great, average user, not so much., It's not a bad unit if you're not willing to spend the money on the higher quality cameras. Bought it for hunting but it's hard to use in a pinch., No comparison to the GoPro.Not many features. No zooming capabilities. I guess you get what you pay for.Update: since posting the above I was contacted by Akaso and offered a partial refund which I received immediately once I agreed to it. Very good customer service., Camera shoots video really well for the price, however the app that goes with it is garbage, This is a good value camera we use for family events. Great price for an action cam, It's a solid camera pictures are ok. But, they look better on my phone. The batteries die pretty quick, I bought this as a second action cam to use for a different angle. The reviews I saw made it look impressive. My main camera is a Gopro Hero 4 so the video and audio quality just doesn't compare. If you were using 2 or 3 of these you could get by ok but this one just can't begin to keep up. It's kinda like a Volkswagen and a Ferrari having a race.One handy item with it that I didn't think I would use in the remote control. For videos, I just don't see much use but for snapping a picture it does \"ok\"., Not what I expected., Did not like that it was not compatible with my laptop or my android phone.  I needed a Mac computer or video editor to down load my videos., Fell off my motorcycle and broke and pieces first time out never got to use it, This product never worked. I took two videos and then it stopped turning on. Being the only camera I took on my trip to Egypt, I was very dissapointed., Takes amazing still shots at 60 fps while traveling at 55+ mph. Do not buy this if you are mounting it to anything that goes down the road. Instead spend a few dollars more and get the Brave 4 which is the upgrade to this model, which includes image stabilization. I can't report yet on how good that feature is on the other camera having bought it to replace this one. However, this one creates unwatchable video, at least mounted to a motorcycle. The image shudder is horrendous. You see some four different layers of the horizon jumbled together when playing back the video on the computer.  On this lower model the remote required the camera to be active for the two buttons to work. They do not turn the camera on. They don't stay lit as an indicator. On the back the lcd is nice, but to determine which mode is active, you have to look closely for the white camera icon to go red, when recording. When taking a snapshot, the screen flickers and resets to the camera, non recording mode. I used this flickering  indicator to know if the camera was recording, while looking through a tinted windshield where its mounted on the front of my bike.The upper model seems to have addressed some of these concerns, for the better. I'll have to review it once i get out on the bike and test it. There is yet another model that is even higher priced than the Brave 4, that one s You tuber claimed had real 4k and not digitally processed 4k like these two lower models, if that's a concern. I had no complaint with the still frame on this camera at speed, set to 60fps, even if it is not true 4k., This arrived with the plastic part that holds the camera to the handle broken.  It worked for the first couple of days, then the charging became iffy to the point where I had to hold the cable titled for it to charge. Then the next day the USB port fell inward into the unit and it could no longer charge.  The failure of the USB port after only a couple uses indicates that the manufacturing of this product is inferior. The camera was returned., Used it 4 times and now it doesn't work. I hope the added warranty is better than the camera., I bought this camera to help record a ski trip with my kids.  The biggest negative I have for it is that the camera is not waterproof.  I couldn't get any audio with the camera because it was stuck inside a waterproof case the whole time.  The worst part is the case got scratched on the lense so now I cant use the case and cant seem to find a replacement., DONT DO IT!!! My husband and I got this for our cruise and the SD card wouldn’t go in the camera. It’s like a piece was blocking it from going in so we couldn’t use it at all. Tried to get in contact and nothing. Spend the extra money for name brand of this is what off brand is like., I appreciate the quality of this product, Just received this yesterday. I have downloaded to apps in order to get videos. One says it download once you go to it you can only hear it. The other one let's you download it but can't share it anywhere because it's only the sound as well. You need a better app for people who only have phones to use. I'm going to try a couple more things but so far not really that great because of the app. If someone could let me know what they use for their phone that would be great. Thanks, Positive: product is cheap compare with others in the market. Image and video quality are okay.Negative: wifi features along with app connectivity are bad. Disconnects for no reason and is hard to manage. Sometime it will disconnect from the app but you couldn't work with it manually, unless you give it a hard reset (disconnect the battery). If you want better quality and connection I suggest you go with a GoPro., This item have been open before arriving to me . It box was without its brand new warranty seal, it is very shame why is happening it ? . It is lack of respect to the costumer;  please., Very poor quality overall. Picture, sound, stabilization are all not very good. After reading the other reviews that were positive, I don’t know if I even had the sam camera. Used it for a few hours and tried to be positive. After that, I returned it and got a Go Pro and I am so much happier., This camera came with so many amazing features and accessories! I love how great the underwater camera quality is and that it comes with two rechargeable batteries instead of constantly buying new batteries. It's super easy to use; my 4-year old can even operate it in the pool. Definitely recommend., My wife and I really liked it. For this price to be able to get a solid camera was really clutch! We went on a trip to DR and used it for a variety of adventures and I’m no camera guru at all. Can’t wait to try it for extreme uses., Used camera in and out of water works great the handle on camera needs to be longer to help stabilize the camera shot, Use this for my motorcycle. It does the job for cheap if you're looking for an action cam. 1 thing I would advise is to stock up on extra batteries. My daily commute is approximately 20 minutes and when I arrive, battery is near empty already. Maybe it's my settings(?) Not bad, just expecting a bit more., It works great! Sound is quiet if not connected to the iSmart dv app., Battery life last less than 90 minutes. Screen turns black when you are recording, so you can't see what you are filming. I wouldn't recommend it. I thought it was good at first but for longevity it isn't worth it. If you only plan to do 30 minutes between charges then it is right for you., I'm very happy with this camera. It comes with two rechargeable batteries, several mounts and a water-proof case for underwater footage., I picked this up for an up and coming trip as my primary camera failed after about 17 years (canon). I realize this isnt expected to perform on still photos as well as an SLR but i figured it would do as well as my cheap phone. It doesnt. Still photos are blurred no matter how they are taken. If you use them for thumbnails they are fine but if you plan to take stills of your trips do NOT use this as you will be very disappointed. The remote works. The \"water proof\" case is more like water resistant on the low end. Drop it in the tub its not going to protect your camera in my testing. Also the accessories everyone raves about. Almost all of them are useless outside buying more parts. They have a pamphlet that comes with the device you have to register to get the \"good stuff\". I refuse to do this because it means more spam. It borders on misleading. Anyhow, good low end, cheap and second camera ok for primary \"action\" video but nothing to write home about., good camera for price  def worth it just wish batterys lasted longer, OK here's my review I've loved the camera for since I purchased it and have taken many beautiful videos however, I just discovered that there's really no way of editing it I'm not sure why that is I expected it to be just as easy to edit it as a go pro but it's not.  So if you wanna just look at the videos that you shoot without editing  them it's a good camera takes great pictures but for me without the ability to edit it's basically worthless. I downloaded about 6 different editing software apps on my phone and none of them will recognize the video file.  It would be nice if the company that makes these cameras addressed this issue., - Price is awesome! Won't give me a heart-attack in case I lost it while having outdoor activities.- Camera is small and light enough to be attached to wrist- Camera is water-proof and operates well in water- Images and videos are stable and good quality for this price- It served us well in a recent rafting trip to Yellowstone and more ski trips in the winter., The camara stop recording for not reason and When it was recording you can not watch all the videos. Only a few. And the others video shows error, My son and I started using the AKASO EK7000 4K WiFi Sports Action Camera Ultra HD Waterproof DV Camcorder 12MP 170 Degree Wide Angle yesterday and he had an absolute blast with it. Picture quality was great!  Unfortunately, as we were charging it this morning, the charging port pushed directly into the camera and was shaking around inside! We were able to unscrew the front of the camera and remove the charging port. It looks like it was only attached with two small tack welds. I emailed the company (through Amazon), but Amazon responded that there is an issue with the email address the company provided.  I didn't expect this camera to last forever, but I did expect the charging port to last more than 24 hours!, The camera has one of the worst picture and sound quality I've seen., Our gopro got water in it and ruined, so we wanted a replacement without spending so much money. This is the same size as a gopro...pretty good quality video. It came with 2 rechargeable batteries.  We also got the accessories which are a good cost and have so many options. If you do not want to spend a lot of money this is a great option for you!, It’s works great. My only problem with it is that I was recording a thing for my school and it would suddenly freeze and the only way to fix it was  to take out the battery. Apon further inspection, it would freeze whenever shaken too harshly., Finally got to use my camera on a scuba dive. But didn't really use it cause it leaked and is now not in my return window! Super disappointed!, This camera has ok image quality. It has a short battery life when recording, only about 1 hour. It does not come with a memory card.Rated 3 stars because of the short recording time/ battery life., Image quality for the money was good. Image stabilization not good. Good camera for the money, This camera ruined my motorcycle trip to morocco.  I was hopeing to get some footage of my motorcycle trip.  This camera would not work for me.  It continually froze and would become unresponsive after less than 5 minutes of operation., Nice little action cam for the price. Takes good video. Sound is not the best., Really really poor camera and sound quality. Waste of money to be honest. Bought to record vacation memories and aircraft takeoffs and landings. The sound quality is the worst., The video quality is just ok. This is a case where you see 4K and think its gonna be great, then you get it and its just OK., It is a small camera and I like that. I can take it with me wherever I go if I need it. I like the battery. And is easy to take pictures and video but I don't like too much the picture quality and color balance. All depends how you want to use it., Unfortunately I haven't been able to use this camera but twice. The battery says charged but when I unplug from the power source it shuts off. The buttons are confusing. Manual was no help. I was really excited to get and use this camera for my horse back riding but guess I will look for something else., This is a great alternative to trendy GoPro cameras. It has all the features the kids are looking for for sport videos and more., Good amount of accessories and quality seems as good as the GoPro., Not a bad camera just not was i was expecting. Having a GoPro this doesn’t really compare., After 3 weeks it stopped working.  I returned it for a full refund and got myself a GoPro Hero 5.  It is working well, and longer than this camera.  I would have kept it, had it continued to work., I actually bought 2. I'm changing my original 4 stars to just 2. The quality of the videos I shot and downloaded are very poor. Not the quality of my work! But from the camera. From both cameras. When I first noticed I went and shot with the other camera. Same thing! It's very disappointing., You get what you pay for.... video is extremely jumpy. Picture doesn’t even seem to be 720p., If you want to record your bike rides, this camera is NOT a good choice. It doesn’t have any image stabilization., Image is not clear, not 4K, This camera is easy to use and takes really good clear pictures. I've used this during hunts and for other random things. Great camera., Before I could use it for the third time. The clip that holds the buttons in place. The one for the power. Came off!! No it's useless under water or in salt air conditions!! Not happy at all!!! It was a week old at best!!, A little shakey when running but overall it's a nice camera for the price, Great videos, but the battery life is goes quickly., The battery didn't last very long - a couple hours at most.  The plus side is the camera comes with two rechargeable batteries so I was able to replace it when it died.  Video quality was good, picture quality left much to be desired.  I could've taken better pictures on my phone.  Sound is almost non-existent when in the water proof case.  It comes with many accessories that I couldn't figure out and the manual was no help.  Tons of accessories but not one selfie stick which is really what we wanted.  I bought this for a trip to Kauai and it served its purpose.  If you're looking for an affordable option for a vacation I recommend buying this camera.  If you're looking to get more usage than one trip, I'd recommend investing in a better camera., Great Color. But battery only lasts about 30 minutes., Quality seems very solid, has gone on a few kayaking trips so far and the waterproofing is up to the job.  Video quality is really good although I'll admit I haven't spent any time testing its limits as far as fast action or low light conditions.  I'll probably buy a few more, I have a Gen 1 Gopro Hero and this easily meets the same quality plus more features., Just check the video for yourself! This is a recording of the Audio/Video Sync Test available on YouTube that I recorded just minutes ago. I have emailed Akaso support. I'll provide an update once I hear back., The charging port no longer works, seems the fins in the actual port bent over?, Great value on the dollar., Got this for a trip to the USVI and got some great moments with it, This does not include a needed micro card., I purchased this item thinking it would be a bargain deal that's comparable to GoPro. They're incomparable and I wished I would've spent a little extra for a much better quality GoPro., Like how portable it is yet provides great quality videos, Great for the price. However, it only takes good video and pictures in high light. Low light settings look terrible. Definitely not 1080 p., Video quality is very poor. Cannot be use for anything proper. Phone take a better video, Just bought this for my daughter’s birthday. She will be using this on our vacation this summer!, I bought this camera as a good alternative to the name brand rival that is 5 times the cost, figured what do I have to lose, it’s only $75. I was actually pleasantly suprised that the video quality above and under water is really good. Then I downloaded the software from the app store and was wondering why it has so many bad reviews and barely a 2 star rating. After installing it I attempted to transfer some of my videos from the camera to my phone and the app would crash on any video that is longer then 1 minute in length. Also the downloaded videos remain with in the app and can’t be saved to your stream. In conclusion the iphone app is very poor quality and if you don’t mind removing the SD card to copy the video to your computer then this camera is a good buy, otherwise if you want to use the app on your phone and to transfer the video footage to your phone over wifi I would not recommend this camera or this brand, Image quality and stabilization is bad. Returning the product., Doesn't work properly as expected some time it turns on some time it doesn't battery were fully charge this item sucks, Really easy set up, Works Great!, I used it in my car to capture the back roads and the battery life is a lot shorter than another action camera.  Used it once ride and returned it just because of battery life., Nice action cam but they could do better no stabilization at all, No instructions included but did come with a good bit of attachments, It’s okay... I bought a memory card. When I video the screen blacks out after a min. There were bubbles on the screen when I opened it., I liked the camera and had good picture., Unfortunately the cover of my battery broke and now I can’t used, I wish they would include in the description somewhere that this camera does NOT include audio! Only photo/video. Waste of money for me.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The laptop arrived just in time for school!! Works great., Product description very much lied about the keyboard being backlit. Pretty pissed about that considering it the reason I chose this laptop over others I was looking at. Otherwise, it works fine for the basic little wprd processor I use it for. Also, not a cool design like any online description of the model. This one is straight flat black. Incredibly plain-looking. And one of my keys is at a wonky angle, but it works. Considering the ither asus products I own, this one falls short, honestly.If you want to take it out of S Mode, go to activation and choose to change your edition to regular Windows Home. Its a free switch., Works good.But the keyboard is not backlit.Good buy, if you don't need a backlit keyboard., I love how light weight and compact it is. And the numeric pad as well. So far I’m pretty happy and content with it., I ordered this small laptop for work purposes and general office operations.  So far, it's been well worth the money.  I took it out of Windows S mode.  It struggled (lagged) a bit with Chrome, so I resorted to using the Microsoft Internet browser but it's been fine.  And since I only use it for work (general office stuff), it's done everything that I could have asked....thus far!, The number dial is pretty accurate. Sleek design and very lightweight. Perfect product for the average commuter, If you feel that you need the trifling advantage of the \"easy access\" NumberPad, go ahead and buy this one. If you don't, avoid this one--it's a constant annoyance. Think you can permanently disable the NumberPad? Good luck with that., Amazing product it’s small do you can easily carry it around with no extra weight, For 190 bucks, this is perfect. I think tablets are very overrated.  I only like touchscreens on a phone.  This computer is the size of a tablet, incredibly light.  I just wanted something to do my financial stuff, email, shop and casually browse the internet.  I don't watch movies on my computer but it plays you tube type videos just fine.  sound is a little weak but if I want to listen to music I can cast it to my stereo.  What I like best is the size and weight. Small and light. And it seems to be built solid. I charge it at night and use it off and on all day and there is plenty of juice left. I could probably charge it every other night if I wanted.  I've only had it a couple weeks but I feel very good about my purchase., Screen was good but touch screen sucked...the lol mouse would disappear from screen and just pop up anywhere and wouldnt click on items the 1st click(it takes multiple clicks to get to where I'm trying to go)., It is perfect for my personal use and easy to navigate. Light weight and fits into my bag to carry with me., I like the size and for the price it’s worth buying., small, compact and convenient, Stay away from Windows 10 S ! Let me tell you what it is ..... trash 🗑!!!!!!! You can’t download anything from browser unless is from their crappy App Store! I couldn’t download Sketchup ! This is the worst part you CANT use GOOGLE!!! Like what the F ! They only allow you to use Bing ,who in the right mind uses that search engine!! No oneeee! You have to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to Windows 10 pro to be able to use your brand new computer like a normal person would like to do! Very very disappointed with this stupid “windows 10s” upgrade! (Not even an upgrade)!!!!! Please do your self a favor and buy a Mac !, My wife bought this for email and Facebook essentially. I had to uninstall the Windows 10S features because it kept freezing on the screen that said only approved windows 10 S apps would work.This warning came up randomly even though the only apps on the laptop WERE from the Microsoft App store.Finally I said ok no more Windows 10S and dropped it in favor of plain Windows 10. Since that time there has been no problem and no discernible detriment to the function. It is very small so be advised if this is a concern., ********************************** 07/24/2021 **********************************being firmilier with windows seizing possession of computers overclocking chip-sets and burning them out first on my listidisabled secure boot and set the supervisor password in bios so windows andits automatic this and automatic that could not inflict further damage to thehardware without firstly obtaining my express permissionnot trusting windows and its most advanced network hacking teqnikesi then proceeded to install my 9 GB linux clone in 10 minutes flathowever i needed windows to register this new computer sos i started windowsafter setup finished without a internet connection it said theres nointernet conection try this troubleshooterwhich arived at the decision that i needed to reset the router (NOT TRUE)  duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhbut why win 10 was updating at chip sizlun full throttle thats the true reason  out of pure curiosity i let this rogue os update it took a full day and a halfbefore i could use edge browser to register in my asusand by the way my last laptop used to do the same thing everytime itupdated until i**************************************************************** disabled the automatic updates  ** by setting the ipv4 gateway address to a bad address ** and unchecking ipv6 protocal  ** in the network configuration dialogue  ****************************************************************2 words braught the micysoft madness to a sqeeky halt********  GRUB-INSTALL *********the wifi chip is a realtekRTL8821CE---the cpu temp is a cool 100 degree farenhite after waking from a nap---and under your control linux will run your chipset at 108 degrees farenheightat idle with bluetooth radio on---in linuxvbox windows 98 running the yamaha SYXG50 soft synthysizer which by the wayrenders the dsp effects in software on 12 miditracks laden with yamaha sysex register 20% cpu utilizationand 117 degree farenheit cpu temp and play hifi music without hickupthis vm cuts the battery life to about 9 hours---also the battery has about 19 hours of secure browsing in it using 2048 bitencryption over bluetooth connect---intense usage such as simultaniuos remote desktop and ssl secure browsing bringtemp to even 120 degree and battery life is 1 hour per 10 percent battery capacity---running linux headless and radio off give you > 40 hours of batteryapache2 server + file sharing + encrypted ssh is on---in linuxthe 14 inch keyboard is backlighted up for your pleasure and for due reasonit is almost impossible to see your key in anything but direct sunlighthowever this is a much needed feature regaurdless  A very usefull feature on the extended keyboard is the well placed home and end keyit follows the standard template for laptops except there is one more row on the far rightwhich has the following keyspower buttonhomepage uppage downendFN*******************************************************************************linux xcfe desktop uses about 1.1 gig of memory out of the installed 4 Gigwith 6 virtual desktops and 5 different apps running*******************************************************************************the charging cord is 6 foot loong and she charges up from 50% to 99% in > a hour*******************************************************************************the integrated video tops out at 1920x1080 and bottoms out at 320x180and refresh rates vary from 60 hz to 120 hzthe battery life sinks exponentialy with increased resolution and refresh rates, I just wanted something simple to use for files and meetings. However, the webcam is awful. The image is poor quality and if you move at all you will be one big blur, so I will need to buy a separate webcam to use. The key clicks are loud as you type, and although the number pad on the mouse pad is a nifty option, it will come on and off when you don't intend it to. Overall, not bad for the price, but the high rating seems to be misleading. Not sure how much I trust Amazon reviews at this point, I saw no mention of the poor quality webcam and that was one thing I noticed right off the bat considering how prevalent Zoom is nowadays., Worked great out of the box but would not turn on the next day.  Shame as it was perfect for my needs., Quit working after a week, It has M.2 which supports NVMe SSD.soldered RAM, works pretty fine to me. I buy it for my daughter and it have all thing that she needs., Perhaps I goofed or something, but even a live boot wouldn't take., It is not user friendly., Well worth the price. Small long battery life. Enough capability to support remote learning, Cheap Chinese garbage, So far the L210 slim laptop is good for working on projects and would make a great investment for a highschool or college grade laptop. Had to make a couple adjustments like uninstall the graphics driver and install the intel one because graphics problems with chrome as well as in chrome disable the \"use hardware acceleration when available\" setting because of graphics errors caused. the other adjustment made was creating my own power plan because with the one that comes pre-made for it doesnt do the laptop much justice. basic power plan was 4-6 hours on battery but with a well setup plan have it setup it can do 6-10 hours with videos and 10-12 hours on everything else from browsing web to having multiple programs running. some stuff you should know is the graphics is 2gb which can handle 1080 videos easy depending on your internet speed. 4gb of ram and barely any is actually used unless you have alot of programs running at once. the processor says 1.2ghz dual core but the speeds that have been running are  1.8-4ghz so far depending on whats running. doesnt get too hot when running games or videos so wont get burns when sitting a your lap. 1 thing tho is that it is listed as having a backlit keyboard but it does not have one. After dealing with windows updates and driver updates theres around 20-25 gb left of space available so if you decide to buy one of these laptops make sure to get a micro sd card for it so you can expand the space and i recommend 120-500 gig., Works good, fast, light weight., Outside of the mouse pad \" I like it a lot.\", It's been more than a month since I got mine and about 3 weeks in the touch pad stopped working. Trying getting it fixed by a technician who wants an arm and a leg to fix it. I'm not a fan of using a mouse so disappointment is an understatement at this stage., Remember you get what you pay for. Very slow but for paying bills and very light gaming it is serviceable., Initially I thought I'd gotten one of those rare deals ... something fairly good for a lower price.  I was being optimistic.1.  Screen saver doesn't work2.  When in \"sleep\", you can't always get the computer to wake up - you have to reboot3.  Applications lock randomly - Chrome, Excel etc - initially thought it happened after the laptop had been idle for awhile - but it happens randomly at any time, even when in use.  Some or all app's become locked/unresponsive and you have to close/restart them4. This is more a personal gripe - the sound quality is very poor.  But again, it's a low end computer so it really should be expected - I just didn't expect the sound to be this bad.On the plus side -1.  It is fairly fast and boots quickly, The picture description says BACK-LIT KEYBOARD, but it isn't! Whomever designed the website for ASUS should be fired! I went through a big hassle trying to find an ASUS laptop that actually had the back-lit keyboard that was advertised on several of their models, but didn't have it! I wound up buying an ASUS 14\" laptop that actually had the ADVERTISED back-lit keyboard from Office Depot/Office Max. I had them verify it before I bought it., USPS delivered this today. Big box with a fairly big box (and padding) in it with a small and light laptop in that. I had it unpacked and charging in no time.Since I never intended to ever use the WIN10 installed on it (or even boot it) it took a bit to figure out how to get into the computer settings so that I could boot from a USB drive that I had Linux Mint installer loaded on.A WORD OF CAUTION for those that are going to install Linux - the current popular install .ISO's don't have the drivers for the WIFI chip! The drivers will have to be installed manually. Bluetooth does however work and I was easily able to link this computer to my iPhone and get out to the internet that way.WORK A ROUND: I ordered a cheap (~$20) \"TP Link\" USB 802.11N (only 2.5Ghz) Wifi adapter, plugged it in and it just works. Maybe someday Linux will have drivers for the built in WiFi chip in this device.While the only CPU'S that Intel makes that are crapper than a Celeron is a Atom I found this on the web:\"The Intel Celeron N4020 is one of the most budget-friendly and power-efficient laptop processors. ... As for gaming, the Intel UHD 600 graphics of the Celeron N4020 is one of the weakest solutions. It can be used only for the lightest games.\"To sum up the above, it is a very cheap and uses very little power.For its size, the keyboard and screen are ok. The keys have good travel. It has a matte screen.This is a small and very light computer. It is 'snappy' enough surfing the web and running Linux native applications. While I'm not clear on this but it appears that it can be charged with a standard USB-C charger.I'll have to take it out in the wild to see how the battery life holds up on it. Running Linux the battery should last as least as long (or longer!) than it does while running WIN10., I bought this laptop to use for leisure travel this next year.  Wanted something bigger and more useful than the tablet I currently have.  While I have just started the setup process, ie loading my apps, files, etc., it is doing exactly what I wanted it to do.  I've switched to Windows Home, installed all my apps and it's currently updating Windows.  It is showing lots of promise!, This was a MAJOR selling feature for me since I work nights. Description needs updated., It's fine otherwise, but the trac pad stopped working a few days after we started using it., Recieved yesterday.Still reading info on using micro soft...... I'm use to Google use but this lap top has much more to offer IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET USE TO IT.., Purchased this laptop in March 2021 and it only lasted six months with light use. One day I could no longer connect to the internet. Ran the troubleshooter and it said it could not find a network adapter. Tried everything suggested, but still can't connect to the internet. Total waste of money!, I am giving this tablet two stars as it is inexpensive (under $200) and lightweight, other than that I would give it one star.  I should have read the description more carefully as it is not a touchscreen model.  Get your fingers to work on the touchpad if hard enough but the way this was designed if you aren't very careful you are constantly turning on the numbering feature.  It is a serious stupid design.  You have all the number above the alpha keys. Grab a calculator if you need it.  I waited too long on return it., Excellent for just information support for your job, 365 micro soft is useless, For the price you can’t complain it works for basic usage as browsing the Internet. I would recommend for anyone who needs a laptop with basic functionality ., Easy to use, up in a second.  I love it.  Then I realized that I couldn't hear a damn thing.  I'm on a computer 12 hours a day, I know how to work them.  I adjusted the controls...blah blah.  Could barely hear the volume on some things, particularly YOUTUBE.  Finally looked and lo and behold, the speaker are on the bottom. How in the hell can speakers project when you have the danged thing in your lap?  My thighs completely block all sound.  So in order to hear certain things, I have to hold it up to my face.  Yes, I've trouble shooted everything. Yes, I know what I'm doing, and Yes, I'm sending it back.  SOUND SUCKS and I don't want to have a little speaker attached to the top so I can hear., Perfect for what it has been designed for: internet browsing, music, playing videos. can play Terraria, Arrived without windows bootingUpon boot enter BIOS and I get “no bootable device”. You can tell the manual has been beat up. When filling in return on Amazon I find support phone number but despite being advertised as open nobody answers., I dislike the confusion with it's programs. Not one to be a \"refresher\" on..after so many years!I feel I made a mistake with choosing this.., Laptop is smaller but has everything you need for school and very light so easy to travel with overall good computer for price, Sound stopped working completely after a week, It won't turn on after having it led than 30 days, What I expected, It’s cute, and quiet, but the screen is made in a way that you HAVE to look at it at a certain angle or it feels weird on your eyes and only the center circle is bright while the edges appear dark.  I’ve never hated a laptop screen so much. It’s almost like it has a privacy screen on it., Well it really wasn't what I was looking for. It's kinda slow, and I really couldn't get too many good apps on it. And it seems much smaller than what it's size is supposed to be., I wanted this laptop to do only one thing - act as the control for a label printer, but it couldn't even do that. It took forever to boot, and everyday tasks kept crashing it. Totally useless! I returned it as soon as I could get it to shutdown., This computer was a great purchase for my son. He likes to play Roblox, Minecraft and Steam games. This computer has the capability and speed to play these games and plenty of room to hold them. It is not a gaming computer but is capable of playing these games without too much lag time. The touchpad that moves the mouse icon does like to stop responding to touch but simply press the F6 key to toggle it back on and off and it will start working or plug in a mouse. The battery lasts an extremely long amount of time. The display is very clear and good quality. Excellent product for the price. The seller, Lucky Trading, has excellent customer service and was very helpful with communication and when I needed product support. Highly recommended., I only needed the computer for zoom.  Whenever I touched the mic I had to hit it several times to turn on mic to speak.  It was a pain so I returned the computer.  I prefer touch screen & a larger screen., It took about ten minutes to download Google Chrome, and when it did, simply opening a new tab on the app took at least two minutes for it to fully load. I bought this laptop to use for writing and schoolwork, but the speed was just unbearable., Much smaller than I imagine but was ok. Easy to carry around, fast enough for my use., Dislike nothing! I use it for work  l like that it was easy to use, It's a laptop and it does laptop things. If you need it to do heavy intensive things, it might not do the things.But if you keep your expectations low, you'll probably not be disappointed., The size and range of motion is pretty coolEdit: the family safety automatically being turned on is irritating. The dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. I’ve taken some mins to set the computer up I don’t want to spend more time, Screen might put some people off. Battery is phenomenal, it’s silent, and the audio is fine. Perfect for on the go.   \n",
       "4  Bought for school work. Doing good so far.Sleek., It's alright, I bought this laptop a week ago. The touch pad worked at first. Once, I upgraded Windows 10. The touch pad stopped working. I went to the Acer site, to download a new driver for this pos. Of course it didn't work. That's why I'm giving this a bad review! I've tried several things to fix this laptop. None of them worked!, My son loves his laptop, One of his favorite devices so far.. One suggestion by memory card to go along with this laptop, I purchased this for my online college classes and am so glad I did. Awesome product!, This computer has totally inadequate volume.  The return was readily accepted by the seller but when I actually took the computer into the UPS store, I had to pay $21 to have it shipped WITH the properly printed return label !  Never had to pay to return an Amazon purchase before!!!!  What a ripoff!!!, Best laptop for this price, 5 star, I love everything about this laptop!, Horribly horrible computer! Do not buy! Screen went out in less than a week! Only used it once or twice before it went to H E double hockey sticks to, The trackpad has scrapes in it when I got it. Returned it, it's been two weeks and I'm being told it will take another 2 weeks for my refund to process. The body is also thin plastic and not metal like some other aspire 7s, including the trackpad. Get another gaming laptop, the ROG zephyrus g14 is on sale at best buy right now for almost the same price with a better GPU & CPU and an all aluminum chassis., Basically the one thing that turned me off is that it warns you not to download the Google browser because it may make it unstable., This will be my last Acer. I expect notebooks to last around  3 years and that is when you actually use it. I used this one as a spare and hardly used it at all. In fact I just found it does not even have a battery that you can take out. I would not recommend this product., GREAT little laptop. Performs well. I do mostly work on it (Microsoft Office, Audio editing on Audacity, minor video editing and some music composition with Sibelius) and it runs flawlessly. Occasionally I travel and play games on it (league of Legends and World of Warcraft) and it runs those just fine too (WoW on lower graphics settings). only down side to this machine is there's VERY little memory. Make absolutely sure you budget for cloud storage, or an external hard drive if you go with this machine., Not nearly enough RAM, slows up with just basic web browsing, This is a great laptop for the price, but the worst thing about it is the placement of the touchpad, it's on the left hand side below the keyboard, which makes no sense.  It should be centered or more on the right.The screen color is also a bit bright, so if you want to edit photos on here beware of that.  Also this thing is kinda heavy., This is not bad, but I would not buy it again. The speakers are horrible and under the computer. making it hard to hear (I am deaf) and you have to pick up the computer to hear them. The cap lock key does not a light on it let you know it is on. Drives me crazy. No CD Rom either.  :(, Love this laptop except why would you put the speakers on the bottom which makes the sound horrible?  At least make the max volume higher so you can at least hear without needing external speakers!, Initially, once I set everything up, I was pretty pleased with my purchase! But after a little over a month (and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month), the screen went black but the back-light on the keyboard was still on. So, I figured it just needed to be charged. I left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it. Still, lit keys but no screen. So I changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more. Came back to it, same thing. I tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference. I never took it out of \"S\" mode, and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs. Basically, just checked my email a few times. Now when I plug it in, nothing lights up. The adapter on the charger doesn't have any indicator light to show that it's working, so it could be a faulty power cord.I'm going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers. But in any case, a brand new device should last longer than a month.Now my return window has closed so I'm either stuck with a $350 paperweight, or I'll have to search online and buy a new charger and hope that works..., I do not spend a lot of time on the computer. I purchased the computer so I could do some personal writing. I like the fact that it had Microsoft Office installed. I did not like the the restriction to only use apps provided through the Microsoft store.  To download other apps, like zoom, I had to disable the Microsoft security system, which cannot now be reactivated on my machine.  But as far as general use of the computer, it has been great., Unfortunately, I have to write a bad review on this one. I have babied this laptop and while it was a decent for cheap laptop, I can't believe it just died on me after 14 months. I didn't get a warranty because the price was more than half of the laptop cost...again, inexpensive laptop. I expect slow, etc. but not death., Easy to set up, liked the keyboard. I added another 4 GB memory.  Just a nice overall laptop., It is a lot smaller screen, keyboard, etc., than I had before.  Though I had an Acer Aspire before.  I don't like it, probably will return it, and wouldn't recomment it for older people., Nice laptop for the money. I still don't like Windows. Battery life is lousy, My lab top has quit working. It will not restart it is froze & my mouse will not work it won’t let me do anything, For the price point its a great laptop. First I added another 2GB RAM for under $20 and upgraded. Before I start with the positive one big negative. When the laptop goes to sleep mode, it take 25-40 sec before it wakes up. It's very strange. Its not a traditional hard drive. I didnt change any settings. I have to hit the power button and literally sit there for it to turn on. Pretty annoying. Other than that screen quality is phenomenal. Speed is more than adequate for MS office apps . It can also handle streaming and 8-10 browsers at a time.  For school, work , anything non hardcore this is a good laptop. Sound quality I aways use my bluetooth headset anyway. Sound is bit more towards the stereo sound. I am sure that can be adjusted, just havn't played with it.Like others have said, you cannot go wrong at this price point. I just hope it lasts and dont bog down or slow down with updates and what not...., this laptop is giving me nightmares. the touchpad is super sensitive to \"accidentally\" turning off. ok, fine. restart and it's back to normal if nothing else works (forgetting the inconvenience). then this morning after an update to windows 10, the touchpad isn't simply off. it isn't in settings, there are no drivers, it's just effing gone. so here i am, using a mouse i hate, because the laptop basically doesn't work as a laptop. take into consideration when thinking about purchasing this model. it's cheap, yes, but if you actually need to use on the go or in your lap, it's a bad choice., I purchased this laptop for general purposes as well as using the Cricut Desgin Space for my Cricut machine. My old laptop was just running too slowly and I needed an upgrade. First off, the price is amazing, and I'm fully aware that you get what you paid for but I feel like I got MORE than I paid for with this. I don't know much about specs and the ins and outs of computers so here are some pros and cons from a general user:PROS:- The look and design is very very sleek- Fairly lightweight- The screen resolution - AMAZING!- It seems fast so far- The battery life is very good. I've been working continuously for about three hours now without it plugged in and I still have 1/4 battery life left.- It does come downloaded with Windows 10 S Mode however there's literally a sticker directly on the box directing you to a website that explains a STUPIDLY EASY four step process to permanently get out of S mode. It was the first thing I did (based on other reviews) and have no issues. IT WAS FREE TO DO AND TOOK 2 MINUTES!!CONS:- Caps Lock/Num Lock do not have an indicator light. I'm already finding this very annoying but I use a USB keyboard most of the time anyway so it's fine.- The sound is awful. If you're using this laptop for streaming, games, etc. you will need headphones. No seriously... it's really bad. The quality is okay but it does not get loud AT ALL.Overall with a couple of days of use I'm impressed with this!!! Purchase ASAP if you're looking for an affordable general use laptop :), I bought this laptop for my wife for her job. I wanted something not pricey and just something that worked. I saw the high amount of five star reviews and I read through some of the lower starred reviews and thought, that won't happen to me, BS!!First of all, the computer got shipped quickly and got here undamaged but that is the only good I can say about it. The backlight for the keyboard goes off quickly and you have to press a key to turn it back on instead of moving the mouse and you cannot change it. As you may have read in other reviews, the computer comes with Windows 10 S Mode installed but my product key is not genuine. It says that the digital license is not valid. Because of this it WILL NOT ACTIVATE WINDOWS. Which means I CANNOT TAKE IT OUT OF S MODE. If the computer is in S Mode then you cannot download any apps or programs that you would normally use like Mozilla or VLC or even Chrome. And furthermore, you cannot access the Command Prompt which means you cannot even activate the Windows even if you wanted to.I have contacted Microsoft who told me that they could not do anything and to contact ACER. I contacted ACER and they told me to try one single thing, which I already did and confirmed that it does not work, then told me I had to send in the laptop to the techs which would take another two weeks just to get it back.Sooooooooooooooooo, long story short, it is a never ending loop of disappointment, anger and resentment and a complete waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE., This laptop was overpriced., Screen quality is decentTouch screen not reallyThis isn’t a gaming laptopTurn off the wifi so it doesnt interfere with your cell phones connectivity or other tablet/computer., Overall, a great laptop for the price. I added 8G of RAM really easily. It is fast and cheap. However, some technical issues:- S mode is horrible. Got rid of it immediately.- My powerpoint screen recording function would not work. Called Microsoft and they were very helpful. They rolled back my display driver to Microsoft Basic and worked perfectly, but then the computer would not recognize my second screen. Called Acer, and they told me they didn't have another display driver to download and referred me to a third party (Answers By) that wanted to charge me $99 to fix the issue...- For some reason, the internet was really slow. Played with two different routers I had. It was still slow even with a tri-band router and no other devices connected to the internet. Then, I connected to the guest wifi I had set up and it worked perfectly. I suspect this may be a driver/software issue.For the price, it is hard to beat this, but get ready for some compatibility issues and no support from ACER..., THIS PC WAS GOOD BUT THE CAMERA DID NOT WORK I OPENED CASE THEY COULD NOT FIS IT  POOR PRODUCT SUPPORT DOD NOT BUY THIS PC  DO NOT BUY THIS PC. VERY POOR SUPPORT FROM AMAZON AND ACER, Product wouldn’t work out of the box, and after an hour with tech support made the decision to return., I love everything about this laptop. Especially the built in Alexa. It's so sleek and stylish. My daughter told me it looked just like her MAC laptop. Best buy anywhere for a laptop at a reasonable price with all the features!, Arrived late, Speaker volume is low.great LT for price! Won’t find anywhere else., Stopped working after 4 months of light use., The first time I attempted to use my webcam for a important Zoom interview, it would not work. After Acer did hours of trouble shooting, with no resolve, they told me I had no other choice but to reset my laptop to factory settings, which meant I lost almost everything I had on my laptop. When it was determined that losing all of my content was for nothing, they finally checked the device manager and discovered that no Webcam drivers had been installed! They then told me that I would have to pay to send the laptop back to them for repairs! I refused to pay out anything more. Needless to say I Will Never purchase from Acer again.!, Hard Drive crashed after 7 months and it was going to cost more than the computer to fix., Product arrived on time and was as advertised.  No surprises., Nothing special about this. Recent buy, no issues thus far. Appreciate the graphics card vs the \"newer model\" with the integrated card. Helps with some lighter games and other graphics-intensive apps., Horrible product. Bought it in March and it keeps disconnecting from the internet, sound is absolutely horrible. Now I have a laptop that is absolutely useless., It will not stay connected to WiFi - I constantly have to reconnect to wifi even after just a few minutes of inactivity., Everything is good for the price but  the volume  is to low... l had to return and get an apple instead. Even though it is double the price., This is a nice laptop for the price.  No issues so far at all.  I did need to take it out of S mode in order to install Zoom which is basically mandatory these days., The batter life is trash, and heats up fast, I bought this entry level Acer as an extra to have around and wasn't expecting much for the price.  Everything about this computer is very good EXCEPT for the low volume of the sound.  I'm not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume. I wasn't expecting BOSE quality, but I was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100%; it isn't.  Here's what I did, checked drivers, opened the Realtek to confirm all were set at 100%.  Upon researching other reviews, I noticed similar low volume issues; it appears that this is where Acer skimped. (I have an entry level Toshiba that has horrible quality sound, but it is loud.) I need to Blu-tooth an external speaker just so I don't have to bring my ears to w/in 8\" just to hear.  Of course, it doesn't help that Acer put the speakers on the bottom, yes, the bottom of the unit. It's a shame that Acer did so much right for the price, only to mess up on a incredibly low volume!  Would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100%?  The answer to my rhetorical question is no, but they did anyway.Overall, I would have given the unit 4 stars, maybe even 5, but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3, at best, unfortunately.My take-away is that I won't buy another Acer without hearing the sound first., built in camera and mic not working, Computer works well. Still trying to learn the operating system as it is different from the last computer., Worked fine for 13 months of occasional use, and then out of nowhere, the motherboard failed--just outside of the mfr warranty window. Piece of junk!, I absolutely love this laptop, key board lights went out and i am a senior citizen with eye problems who runs a help line to get services for families trying to get moms into recovery and am limited in times i can help to day times when i can see the keys, Microsoft edge is the worst browser first off, secondly this laptop did an automatic update and deleted several of my saved documents which are unrecoverable- hours of work are lost. It also blanked out 4x during a timed midterm exam last week.I have had this laptop for just 6 months - sad to say, I won’t purchase Acer again., I purchased this product based on many reviews .  After waiting 30 minutes to set up this thing, I called Acer support.  This thing would not set up Windows.  There is a 22 digit serial number that has to be provided fast and you have to use a telescope since the type is very small and is located no where near where the tech said it was.  Am going on 3 hours now to fully set thing up and am about ready to send it back.  Pure frustration.  This thing has all kinds of features but one important feature it lacks is the ability to set it up without having to take 3 hours of your life to do so.  Recommend you buy something else., overall its an ok computer , but the speakers seems damaged, its extremely low and theres a feedback, Computer works great, just as advertised, good value, would buy again, Works exactly how I expected it to and does everything I need it to do. A very good laptop for the price given., I got this for gaming by day 3 the touch pad stopped working. I troubleshooted it for days. Nothing worked. It only works with a mouse. I was very disappointed. I returned this item and will buy a different brand. Really sucks cause I liked it for gaming☹️, I have been very satisfied with this purchase so far.  I've only had it set up for less than a week, so I can't really state how well the battery is going to be,,,but so far it is great.  I have only had one small problem with setting up the email, but I'm just going on my web browser and accessing it from there, not sure what the problem is, probably something on my \"non-thechie\" side of the screen.  It is a great value for the money and I have absolutely no complaints.  The best feature I have found so far is the back lit keyboard....I had no idea how wonderful this would be....it's great.  I used to have to squint or turn on a light, but not anymore.  It's really an amazing little labptop and the screen is crystal clear.  The speed is very fast and so far I am loving this laptop way more than the last 2 Hewlett Packards that I have had to replace due to faulty battery setting.  I love this computer., Works like a charm, Keyboard start to having pressing issue after a while. Specially the one you use most. Otherwise it’s a great computer, I bought this computer for a new full time remote position. The computer is great for VERY BASIC NEEDS. Only a couple tabs open and browsing the internet. I needed to have 10+ tabs open and be able to toggle back and forth very quickly for my role and this computer could unfortunately not keep up. If you need something faster, I would get the same computer but with an i5 processor for $200 more. Well worth the difference. Have had the new computer for a week and it runs remarkable faster and can keep up with what I need done.Also, I plugged in a bluetooth mouse to this computer, and once I unplugged it, I could not get the touch pad to work anymore, so it is a good thing I am returning it as it also had this alternative issue., backlit keyboard is nice, but I hate to have to pay for word processing.  I hate this \"Gortana\" which pops up all the time., it is a cheaper computer that does its job.But the mouse pad thing doesn't work anymore. so I have to use a external mouse, This has the potential to be a good computer, but Acer ships this in S mode. Windows 10 Home cannot be activated. Running SLUI 4 will open the installation ID, but Microsoft cannot activate that number.  The agent said I needed to call Acer.  I called the toll-free number included with the computer and was told by that agent to call Microsoft (whodathunk?) or send it to Acer to be \"repaired.\"  It was out of the box for ten minutes and they wanted it to be repaired! Thanks to Amazon-- it is being returned.  Run  Away., I purchased this computer for my small business job. Within two weeks of use, the down key came off. Amazon's response is to glue the key down, which is ABSURD. You can't just glue a key down, which I explained, but they said that is all that they could do. They would not replace the computer., I purchased this laptop for school / social media / youtube / browsing & i absolutley love it. No complaints so far., It’s really good I actually got it two days earlier than they said they were going to send it to me which that is great, Not lasting more then 1hr! And lagging when you unplug the cable., Still working on this. Hope to up my rating if we can get things working. First experience with the system was very positive. Issue is that on day two I saw a message in the lower right corner of the screen: \"Go to settings to Activate Windows\". Settings says \"We can't activate Windows on this device because you don't have a valid digital license or product key. If you think you have a valid license or key, select Troubleshoot below. Troubleshooter says \"Something interrupted our troubleshooting.\" Called Acer support and was told they would mail me Windows Installation USB memory stick. Waited a little over one week and asked for status update. Was told that USB install media was not available, and I should contact Microsoft for activation. Entered last four digits from activation error message and was told I would need a new product key. Contacted Acer support again, and was told we would need to return the computer to the factory for fix; which could take 15-20 business days, plus shipping time. Briefly considered returning to Amazon, be decided to try the Acer service option. Will be awhile before we get it back., The physical device is very nice.  Lighted keyboard good EXCEPT no indicators for Caps Lock nor Num Lock.  That is unfortunate (what, Acer saved $2 to not include two little leds). Bluetooth non-operating out of the box so will need to troubleshoot.  Touchpad stopped functioning after a few weeks - another thing to troubleshoot...  Hope that is all the bad stuff that happens to this new machine., We got this as a grad. gift for our grandson. Great price, great laptop & fast delivery!!, Flimsy.  Returned it., Finally unboxed this laptop.. have not used much but the charger that came with it is not original making me think it's a refurbished laptop advertised as 'new' or sent a used one.. will update this review when I've used it a bit..if I don't return it..., It very light weight but not very fast. Screen quality it’s good., Purchased this for a high school kid. Does what it needs to do. The base model is ok. I like that you can upgrade this in the future. They included the bracket for a secondary drive. I will be buying more of these for clients, Works well for school Wish I had read I to description more No sd card or disc reader So cost wasn’t as well as I thought after buying external  readers, Windows does not run as smoothly on the Acer as it did on my Dell. My games do not work as well. Have to refresh page often when searching on internet. Not happy with this product., Can’t complain about an Acer product for the price and quality!, I live everything about it except the battery lifeI constantly has to recharge it to appoint i just kept it plugged most of the time, A good performance., To summarize, you get what you pay for. I was not expecting to run into so many problems right when I took this out of the box.1. Immediately I heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when I pulled it out of its packaging.2. The sound is so bad it's like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store. The speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality.3. Loud fan when it gets a little warm when using.4. Scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs. I had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos I noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs.5. Customer service from both Acer and Amazon makes it difficult to fix your/my issues. I contacted customer service the same day after I received this laptop and also the day after. After telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to Acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed.6. Possible restocking fee. Wanting to return this item, even though I barely used it the first 2 days, customer service told me that I cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it BEFORE they can tell me whether or not I will be charged a restocking fee. If you don't like being surprised by restocking fees, don't buy this laptop so you won't have to return.7, I was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem (basically to spend more money just so I can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file.8. Screen quality is definitely not good. I would give it a 6/10. The color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor, the difference is super noticeable.9. 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me. You would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you're basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usable.I know this has good reviews but don't be fooled by it. I was swayed when I was going through the reviews but after I got my product, I was highly disappointed. I wish I had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop. This one is not worth the regular price. I would say with the issues and quality of this laptop, the price should be around $250., Works fine.  Sound could be louder., I tried 3 of them they perform differently from each other and they appeared to have different hardware suppliers internal parts made by random manufacturers for example M.2 port is only PCIE X2 speed  and advertised internal sata3 port performs about 300mb write and 500mb read on a drive rated 530mb write 550mb read.Over it looks as if it was put together in a hurry debris around plastic body can easily can cut hands skin etc., This laptop is great and I had it for months, but when I first got it I had to pay another 100 dollars to take s mode off of it., The computer itself is great for basic use (checking email, browsing the internet, writing papers, etc). I bought it because I have a MacBook and most Department of Defense websites aren’t compatible with Mac OS. My biggest complaint is that 1 month into owning it, the charging cable doesn’t seem to work anymore and I’m terrified for the day that the battery dies and I have no way of charging it after that., Not good as described. Not hapoy with battery performance., It's a great laptop sometimes it can act a bit uppity but just restart it if you just installed some apps. Also it comes on S mode which you can change to regular windows 10 for FREE!  Go in settings > application > Switch to windows 10 mode, Good laptop but ended returning, found one better., Cheap laptop.  You get what you pay for.  No hard drive.  No cd player.  Mouse board difficult to control., The product key on the laptop was bad and so I could not activate it. Acer customer support was horrible, told me if I had bought it directly from them they could have given me a new product key but since I bought it from Amazon I'm pretty much on my own. Last time I buy this brand., Machine is a really great budget machine. I got it for my wife for school but more than just a throw away machine. In the standard form, it was nothing great. Adding more RAM woke it up a lot. Better overall performance.The back-lit keyboard is huge plus for working at night. Screen resolution and clarity is great as well., I had to return my laptop after the mouse cursor had mysteriously quit working after 3 days of use. While I am used toto Apple products, I tried troubleshooting my Windows laptop, even tried restarting in Safe Mode to troubleshoot, without resolve. I even performed Windows Recovery. Still, no resolve. Confused, I thought, That’s okay, I am within the allotted time to return my laptop. So, I requested a Return and opted for a new replacement (vs. refund). I was careful to ensure I remained in compliance with the Return Policy as set out by Amazon and followed the instructions, step-by-step. I downloaded the RA# and UPS label provided and used it to return my laptop as instructed. The following day, I checked the Amazon website for status of my return, only to discover that all information about my return mysteriously disappeared! I didn’t think much of it as more than a temporary technical error, as it was admittedly nearing the deadline for return. Having carefully followed instructions per Amazon’s Return Policy and with my Proof of Shipment Receipt from UPS, I was confident it would work itself out. NOPE. Evidently not. More than two weeks later, NO REPLACEMENT, NO REFUND, NO RESPONSE. …NO COMMUNICATION. And, Four to Five text messages later to the Seller (via Amazon website) — along w/ submission of my proof of shipment receipt and tracking# — STILL NO RECORD OF iNITIATION OR TRACKING OF MY RETURN. The History of my messages to Amazon / Seller and my Return Request are also *POOF* GONE!What the $&@! NO PHONE NUMBERS; Just the runAround.Apparently, I am now out $500 — AND a laptop. …Fabulous.KNOW THE RISK!, This laptop is 14\"!!! I'm soooo angry!, This laptop is great, its affordable and have a bunch of cool features. The only issue is that it is extremely low. you definitely need a headset or speakers. I have to lift the device to my ears to hear if I dont have any of these available.  I have had it for a year and so far so good., I love it.  Easy to work with, screen is small. whole computer is really a tiny bit larger than a notebook, but the processor is fast and all.. I thought i was upgrading, but i have to wear glasses when using this thing to see the letters., I HAVE ORDERED FOUR ACER LAPTOPS FROM AMAZON IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND LOVE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE BUY A FIFTH ACER LAPTOP, AFTER READING ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS ONE. THEY WERE WRONG AND VERY MISLEADING. I SHOULD HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, THEY WERE ACCURATE. THIS ACER LAPTOP WAS THE WORST, SOUND SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE, YOU CAN BARELY HEAR IT EVEN IF YOU TURN IT UP TO THE MAX, THE MOUSE PAD AND KEYS WERE UNRESPONSIVE, CAN'T ADJUST THE SETTINGS, ETC. I USED IT FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY MINUTES,..... 30 MINUTES  AFTER I CHARGED IT AND I PUT IT RIGHT BACK  IN THE PACKAGING.  I COULD NOT GET IT OUT OF MY HOUSE FAST ENOUGH.  WITHIN AN HOUR, I CALLED AMAZON FOR RETURN AUTHORIZATION TO PICK UP THE LAPTOP THE FOLLOWING DAY.  I GOT MY FULL REFUND, AMAZON'S EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE SAVED THE DAY.  GREATLY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS ACER LAPTOP. BUYER BEWARE., Cons:-over heats-speakers are horrible can barely hear videos (had to install an additional app to make sound louder)-computer lags a bit (shouldn’t lag for the price of it)- not recommend for the pricePros:-Good quality when watching videos etc, I like everything about this computer EXCEPT THE VOLUME-YOU CAN BARELY HEAR ANYTHING ON IT!, dislike the teeny hddlike I can throw an external drive on it and am gtg after taking it OUT of s modenear perfect for my needs and decent price, Not touchscreen as was advertised in the question and answer section. The graphics are so so. Worse than my last Acer. Overall 4 stars., Good computer. I’m using it to create elearning.When I tried to remove the computer from Windows S mode, I realized that the computer did not come with a product key. What this means is in order to remove S mode, you have to buy Windows Home or Pro and use the product key to remove S mode. I wish they would have just told me that! I contacted the company via amazon chat, they said I needed to contact the manufacturer. They gave me a phone number. There is a button on amazon to contact the manufacturer as well. No success.I ended up just buying the downloadable Windows home version and used the product key to remove S mode. I also purchased the microsoft software for powerpoint, word, excel, etc.That's a lot of drama just to be able to download things to my computer. Just know that you are buying a bare bones computer when you purchase., Was a great computer until I had used it twice for Zoom and now the speakers no longer work.  If I figure out why I will update., When I first received this laptop everything seemed great, I was very excited to set it up with my personal information and get going-- I very quickly realized, however, that this computer was EXTREMELY slow for my tastes.  Even with no background programs, simple tasks like opening file explorer or a web browser took far too much time.  In my opinion, a brand new computer should be opening programs almost instantly, not leaving me waiting a few seconds or more.  This is ultimately preference, but I'm sure there are many more laptops out there for a similar price point that would run much faster.  Returned this after only a day or so of having it and ended up with another laptop from the early 2010's and it runs much better than this one., I had this laptop for about 2 months now and I'm loving it so far. It's lightweight, sleek, and the backlit keys are great for me in my dark room. It boots up in seconds ready to go when you turn it on. I mostly use this for watching videos and streams and excels it that. The only negative that I can think of is the placement of the speakers. The speakers are placed on the bottom and really muffle the sound so my volume is always at max. Other than that the laptop is a great budget buy., Displeased. Some black (looks more like green) dotted lines are running down the middle of my screen. Looks like some kind of defect. The laptop was purchased at the start of September and didnt see usage until about the 25th of September, which means In about two months this situation happened. Was satisfied with my purchase before this occurrence., I’m not sure if it has “touch screen”., Poor quality. Cheap, just like the price. Laptop is unlikely to last you long. Charging port was junk.On the positive side, it is very light and small.If you choose to purchase this laptop, best of luck to you., The battery died after a week and the screen started blinking. I needed to connect an external monitor to work. BAD BAD BAD., I was told I was going to get a new battery sent to me because every since I have the laptop it will only turn on if it is plugged in to the wall and i never received a new one.., very cheesy one , keep freezing ,not able open files or photos , not going waste my time to fight that, I love this laptop. The screen is a great size. It’s light weight not heavy and very sleek., Good laptop, I don't do anything out of the ordinary.  Does what a laptop is made to do.  I stayed with ACER because my previous laptop was ACER.  If it didn't lose the 'W' key function I'd still be using it, but would buy a new battery because unless it's plugged in it randomly shuts down, bad battery. So, the new laptop had a new surprise.  The sound volume is very poor.  Now lugging a wifi speaker along wherever the laptop goes.  I have to not recommend for this very reason., Absolute garbage, I really dont write reviews but when I do I usually make them for the people this laptop is good when it works but I only used this about 10 times and now it does not charge or turn on pretty much got robbed I'm really disappointed I was really hyped about this product but no durability whatsoever no scratch or anything looks brand new and it's a lemon buyers beware., Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop 15.6 inches Full HD computer stop working this month July 2021.  I purchase this item in October 2020 as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  Unfortunately, the computer has stop working and the battery will not charge.  Please contact me in reference to the warranty information.  I would not purchase another computer through AMAZON.  No customer service support when needed., bought this for my brother laid up with back surgery-easy to work great graphics and definitely user friendly!, All ok so far, cute unit--but does not work after two hours =  black screen & deadmay i have a replacement unit?, I love this computer, but the mouse pad doesn’t work. Had to buy a wireless mouse to even use it. But otherwise great product, Good quality, use it to work from home and meetings and classed., I faced several issues with this PC in spite on light usage. First google meet does not work on all browsers and suddenly mutes the conversation. We spent ages trying to solve this problem until we discovered that it works only on microsoft edge.Sound quality is not clear and low.Finally the battery stopped charging and the laptop does not work except when it is plugged in power. All of this happened after less than 8 months of usage.A total waste of money, The product arrived with a bad wireless card. I returned the item and the refund was applied to a Amazon gift card instead of my credit card. I am not happy., I’ve had this computer for a year and for some reason the computer won’t work unless it’s plugged in. I originally got it for college, but the pandemic caused me to stay and do school at home. I haven’t spilled anything or dropped the computer so I don’t know what the problem is., Nice PC but the backlighting went out after 3 weeks and Acer couldn't help me. Having a laptop without being able to see the keys is not good., Bought one year ago, already falling apart. Lacks durability.  Good for a few months, then you'll need a new one.  The input to the power cord is broken and now the laptop won't charge.  The lever that opens and closes the laptop pulled apart. Stay away.  Terrible quality., I baught this laptop and after just a month and a half the mouse pad won't work. Scam, ALL ELSE OK, I regret buying this laptop and spending all the extra money in shipping.I am having two major troubles with this laptop:1 - The laptop slows down and lags badly once unplugged from power. It runs fast and fine when plugged. It's so bad. I have gone to Control panel and under power settings created a different profile for high performance and gone to advanced power settings and set everything to high performance and still the issue persists.I upgraded the RAM to 16GB. Same issue. I have done countless troubleshooting as seen on different websites, my windows is updated. I have switched off most background and start-up apps and it's still same. I just don't understand why I can't have the freedom to use my laptop at high performance when unplugged. This is crazy. I'm suspecting AMD and Acer to be behind this. This issue sometimes doesn't happen but most times it does.2. Second issue is that when connected to hotspot, this device will from time to time shut off internet connection for not obvious reason.So I could be in the middle of an important zoom meeting and off she goes.Don't buy this if you want peace of mind. The back cover also is inferior plastic., Considering I had a Toshiba laptop for over 10 years with no problems, I expected better of this. But two months into it the touch pad and cursor died. Fortunately I still had the wireless mouse and keyboard so the laptop is still functional.I don't have the time or patience to fool around with a return. When I buy a product I expect it to work. We'll see how long it lasts., Track pad broke within 1 month of use. Amazon was no help., Extremely happy with this. I have a laptop i can take on the go for long business trips even upgraded the ram to make it even better. Glad i found this.   \n",

                                                                                                 i will admit i was very skeptical from reviews but i decided to purchase anyways and so far so good battery life is about 7 hours of constant use games videos etc sounds is good i had no problems connecting to internet the border of the phone did appear to have some scratches but not too many the phone i received has a loose charging port that should have been replaced it was at 27 just now and i plugged it in and opened an app now it just gave me the under 20 notification so it is obviously struggling to keep the cord in place no working well cannot download any apps horrible phone my old android works better than this junk please refund money diana manuele it is for personal and the battery life issues is crazy it is only take 2 hours worked slow barely charged battery life is not good at all only last an hour the worse i never bought battery is dead and i sent it in africa so no way to return it just lost my money i could give 0 star i am very picky with my phone cases which means i keep buying them until i find one that is jut right this phone case has everything i am looking for it is not to bulky and has a slim fit it is enclosed and has a built in screen protector the front plastic trim does not cover top and bottom front of the like some cases making the screen appear smallerthe rubber is stiff and durable and not like those cheap ones the stretch out over timeone reviewer stated they had to keep taking it apart to get the moister out well this is not a waterproof case and if it was it would be heavier and bulkier i am wondering how that much moister is getting in ther in the 1st place are you bathing with it tip instead of drenching the phone with cleaning solution then wiping it up try spraying the cleaning solution on the rag itself just enough to coat it then use that to clean the screenanother reviewer stated the back falls off if you do not snap it in correctly this will happen solution go to an arts and crafts store or fabric store and ask for some double sided hem tape it is very thin and extremely strong it will keep that back on if it is a defect phone broke a little after a month was only given a small back on return and was never told why after multiple emails do not buy phone appeared to be flawless when it arrived it stopped recognizing any sim card after 3 months even though it was a few days out of warranty when it died the seller still took it back for a full refund too small in size the phone looks great however the battery life was 70 instead of the promised 80 this means that the battery dies very quickly even when fully charged we attempted to contact the seller but received no response we would have settled for an exchange but again no response looks like we have to buy a battery add another 50 to the price to get a fully refurbished phone very disappointed hey it is an iphone i did have to buy ear buds for this unit as none came with itthe phone is ok but the battery is horrible gsm does not work this version of iphone cannot be repaired i stop being able to update because it does not connect to the local network it is without service that is now it helps me to connect only by wifi and to listen to music battery drains from 100 to 0 in 2 hours of use the battery is at 50 i mean impossible to use it lousy purchase they should withdraw it from circulation to these iphone 7 phone came in on 86 battery life and touch screen does not like to work would not recommend this phone phone works great but battery needs replacement per the iphone settings screen just over 3 months after purchase does not hold charge for long even with all settings optimized not using gps in background etc otherwise price was reasonable the phone battery was supposed to be at 80 or better but this battery only 77 and apple saying need to replace battery now it is too bad vendors do not install new batteries and increase the price because changing these batteries is not fun as you can have screen damage and broken wires aside from that very happy with phone and fast delivery good condition but instantly overheats when charge not sure if that is normal but the body of it great condition this iphone 7 gets really hot as soon as you charge it also it charges slow the phone is unlocked no scratches no flaws came right on clear packaged for fragile item very well my daughter loves her new phone it is hard to buy from a third party and it not working is frustrating my review is half bad and half good it came in almost a week which i was crazy waiting for it i was so happy when it got here i checked the battery capacity and it only charges to 62 which was so disappointing it charges really fast but loses a lot of percent quick other than that everything was good it came with a charger and charger block i ordered from trademore to get a refurbished iphone 7 and it arrived fully ready to go out of the box with the latest ios version installed all i needed to do was add in my sim chip and sign on with my apple id and icloud backup restore did the rest the unit i received works like new and was actually flat as opposed to some other refurbs i have had it had some scratching on the glass but not over the actual display area trademore and amazon refurbs may seemed more expensive than refurbs from elsewhere but it is worth it for a great unit with no hassles or technical gotchas it took a while for this to become an issue at first i was restarting the phone which i thought was fixing the problem but the proximity sensor does not function properly as a result when i attempt to talk on a call the screen remains lit and the side of my face continually hits the buttons resulting in frustration for both me and the caller it is impossible to hold a voice call at this point unfortunately by the time i realized what the problem is the phone is not eligible for a refund easy to use i got my iphone 7 opened it was fine owner did not factor reset it i turned it on an it was on home screenworks well i like it 810 batter health was at 70 not the promised 80 bad phones you are not honest i bought this for a july gift it stopped working 8 months later it would no longer receive a cellular signal it took about a week to troubleshoot with the mobile carrier before they said it must be your phone i took it to a phone repair shop and they said the motherboard crashed so i got this phone when it originally came it had more damage than what was listed so i returned it the next one that came in had little to no damage so i was excited however after the 30 day return window of course the phone has been having all sorts of problems i have audio issues with my phone on speaker the keyboard gets stuck constantly and the battery life is pretty much nonexistent incredibly pissed i bought this for 230 and now can only get 60 if i sell it back just a warning but if you buy your phone from here you are gambling with your money honestly so just do a payment plan through your provider or get it from apple and spare yourself the frustration died every 20 minutes and constantly shut off and if it was colder than 50 degrees it would not turn on i am disappointed with this phones battery life i have to make sure i keep a charger with me everywhere i go this is my first experience with an iphone so maybe that is how they are i do not know this was in good condition and battery life good seller guarantees 80 battery received phone with battery capacity of only 75 seller never replied to follow up messages and only offered a 20 credit and never replied when alternatives were requested bought this refurbished iphone for our daughter we like the parental controls that apple offers we are not going to buy her a new expensive phone so it is nice to get a used one from amazon overall good product the cameras kind of glitches at times but it overall works the battery dies very quickly but it works perfectly fine even without a sim card very good product i just got this for my middle school son in time for school to start it needed charging upon arrival but the charging cordplug that came with it did not work luckily this is a replacement phone and we have other chargers in the house and so were able to get it chargedit is working so far i cannot comment on battery life yet because it is too soon the phone appeared to be in excellent condition overall satisfied with iphone 7 transaction the phone arrived in pristine physical conditioni could not find a scratch on itthe battery however had 78 capacity not the 80 advertised not sure it would have made a difference as this phone was for my 12 year old son and in the end i decided to replace the battery which granted is not for everyone as it is not a 5minute process more like an hour and 44 minutes processwas able to successfully change the battery and all is well so netnet was able to get a likenew iphone 7 for under 200recommend this vendor but do know if you are not comfortable swapping in a new battery you will be charging your phone 23 times a day as normal phone usage will deplete the battery quickly i like everything i do not dislike nothing fine i like is because it was a easy set up and everything was good on it i have to go to apple because i got this phone for verizon and it will not let me make calls or texts sooooo basically do not buy it i was pleasantly surprised after reading a few notsogood reviews but the iphone 7 verizon that i received looked like it was brand new it was packaged very nicely in a custom box with a new charging cable and ac converter not a single scratch on it battery health was rated at 84 and everything worked perfectly frankly i cannot imagine why someone actually traded this in for a new phone but i am glad they did my daughter currently my tech support person was sweet enough to get me a very nice youmaker protector for it she knows i am a bit clumsy i have only had this phone for a few weeks but so far so good i even use it for visual control fpv on a few of my quadsdrones it is remarkable how well the battery holds up for that video on 1015 minute flights much better than my old iphone very glad i bought this runs slow colabirtation is off and screen glitches battery life is insufficient and less than expected phone came fast and everything is good but the battery only holds a charge for about an hour when it is not charging pretty annoyed about this bad battery life junk charger just buy new instead of having to do it anyways home button non functional was not bad came in good condition if i can fit everything i did not like about this phone into this box i would detail itbut whoever replaced the screen did a horrible jobwont register any sim cards to any carrierit looks like i bought it from wishcom there is a black line when trying to take pictures takes horrible pictures the phone is used and it does not earphones everything was great like brand new like many read a lot of bad reviews was worried that there would be major issues upon getting the phone however my phone showed up next day super fast opened up the packaging and the iphone 7 looked very very good couple very tiny scuffs but was expecting such as it is a used phone would give it a 910 and i am picky called my phone provider and they were able to switch it to my number no problem i have sprint which has merged with t mobile i got the fully unlocked phone for anyone wondering after running the phone through all its tests everything is in proper working order battery life is at 84 which is fine by me higher than the stated number of 80 anyways never really payed attention to that stuff on the other phones i have had all i can say is that the phone is doing everything it should and i am very happy with it if there is one concern the phone may be running a hair warm but nothing to seem worried about momentarily i will update this post at any point in the next 6 months if need be but so far so good company i went with tech exchangee ny screen had a small crack and a chip and the back has some marks on it and the home button is difficult to make contact however the phone does work cord does not work this device only worked for 6 months and it started decaying i send it to apple and they stated that it will need a new motherboard this was for personal use the phone has been nothing but trouble since the day we got it will not make calls or will make calls on its own we do not even when we are not even trying need to know if there is insurance on this purchase or is there any kind of warranty on this purchase item came without a charger i have been using my phone for about a month from what i have been able to assess so far the phone has been working properly the battery holds fairly well unless playing a game on the phone it drains the battery pretty quickly the siri function the finger print unlock and camera are pretty amazing and they are some of the many things that i did not have on my iphone 4so this is a wonderful upgrade for me very average product must have been used for couple of years before reselling it battery life was at 80 when arrived good purchase if one wants to buy iphone at cheap price phone works great i have to say no problems so far 55 have this phone just over six months it glitches turns off all the time battery drains fast phone will not shut off even when the battery is at 98 the amount of money i spent on it i should have gotten more than 6 months use would not recommend the phone barley work cannot call nobody cannot text nobody why it dies so fast it is ok it is a good phone over all but often freezes or hangs up calls on its own dies very fast annoying the stop working in 2 weeks extremely scratched and banged up should not have passed quality control unless the standards are that low perfect condition the battery on my other phone was only lasting me from 7 am 1 pm so i figured i would get a new phone the new phone is lasting from 7 am 11am and says the battery is 100 healthy worst purchase ever do not waste time on this item does not even turn on turns mad hot 1st day on arrival does not turn on 2nd day return hopefully all turn out good with money back update later on phone has no signal antenna broke internally on phone within 4 months just outside the 3 month return window worked great until then i liked it except for the fact that the back had some dints in it and you cannot turn it on silent mood look good speaker are not working arrived a day early which is usually nice but i planned my schedule around it arriving on the estimated delivery date it had obvious wear on the back and there was a small blotch on the screen that must have been dead pixels or something because it was pure white regardless of what was on the screen i did not like it in this condition so i returned it and they said they would deduct return shipping cost from my refund but they ended up not doing that the phone i received did not have a working microphone could not record or make calls the company issued me a full refund they have great customer service but sold a faulty device so i gave a neutral rating honestly i was so nervous to buy a phone from amazon for the 7 year old stepson but reviews can be very deceiving phone worked great now if i can only get this 7 year old to come back to earth and stay off the phone lol needles to say he loves it the phone does not work i can hear a person i call but they cannot hear me i loved this phone for about a half a year and loved it however i got a message saying my sim card could not be read turns out that this is a known iphone mistake when iphones are built when i brought it to the apple store they said that because it was originally made in japan they could not fix it or send me a new one i am now out for a new phone however it worked very well when it did i just would not risk it my battery dies way too soon the package also arrived much later than expected and also had a decent scratch in the screen deep enough to affect the overall appearance the camera works just as expected but it definitely was not the new look you can definitely see the precious wear and tear on the iphone no work for verizon great phone thank you i was confused by the packet i received with item it said iphone 5s i was ready to returni am a new iphone user i was kind of disappointed with charger not working had to buy additional one to use phone overall its a great item the phone was very nice looking phone but i had to return the phone due to it was not compatible with my sprint network service the phone constantly restarts itself the battery lasts all of 10 minutes i do not recommend buying a phone from this company they are junk i have only had this iphone 7 a few days the reason i bought it is because my previous iphone would not hold a charge for more than a few hours so far this iphone will hold a charge for 2 days with moderate use i am happy with it so far the charger that came with it did not work but i still have my previous iphone charger that did work other than that i am happy with it it did not have any scratches or anything and looks brand new this review is for the seller hybrid it first of all i was not expecting it to come as fast as it did i ordered my phone friday at 3 am and received it saturday by 12 pm that is kind of insane since they are in ny and i am in fl there are a few small scuffs on the bottom of the device near the speaker but otherwise it is pretty close to perfect cosmetically the screen has no scratches at all i cannot tell if it is the original but if it was replaced they did a hell of a job the max battery capacity is 100 it came with a charger but no headphones or headphone adapter so you will need to buy one i have not experienced any issues so far but it is only been a day so i will make sure to come back and give an updatealso if you have metro by tmobile and you are having trouble getting service after inserting your sim you have to register the phone with them before it will work not sure about other carriers for a second i thought i received a lockedstolen phone but i wanted to make sure do not give up unless the carrier actually tells you it will not work you can try calling the customer service number and doing it with the automated system or a representative but if you do not have access to your old phone you need to go into the store it took 5 minutes and only costs 1520 depending on where you liveoverall i am extremely pleased it was a risk but i am happy i seem to have gotten a good device thankful for all the reviews recommending to buy from this seller the maximum capacity of the battery was on 74 when i received the phone i can only use the phone for a few hours before the battery is completely dead other than them sending it with a bad battery the phone works great do not buy this phone i got this in today after looking for a good phone for my son for about 2 months the home button did not work and you cannot use verizon it is not amazon renewed its a scam phone is ok no marks or scratches but came with outdated ios that needed to be updated prior to transferring data from old phone battery life is not great there are times when a phone is set to support another carrier and even after a full factory reset any carrier update will kill your mobile network happened to me sprinttmobile reset it and tried multiple times and every time we got it to work it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a daythat means no calls no text no internet if you are outside of wifibe warned and keep your old phone handy you may be disappointed like i was every renewed phone i have gotten before this one had a renewed battery this one did not will have to get one soon phone charge only last a few hours would not have bought it if i would have known the battery was not renewed ok it was good phone till a month after purchase kind of salty about it still wish i did not spend on the phone also did not come with the right charger i like the condition of the phone it really looks as good as newthe problem is on the earphones plug should provide the adapter the phone was ok i had a few issues but nothing major gof a great product fast response phone worked great for about 6 months then it stopped connecting to the cellular service trying to update it and the phone says that i cannot called apple support and they cannot do anything since phone is no longer under warranty everything was good except the battery came to me at 80 capacity so when it charges to it is never better than 80 the seller offered me a 2000 credit but i cannot find an authorized dealer to change the battery this phone is almost perfect the only thing about this device is that i cannot get it turned on due to the fact that it will not accept a sim card i found this misleading due to the fact that they told me my device was renewed and compatible with certain carriers nice piece my son loves it arrived quick looks new works great he is been smiling since received the phone in the usual blank white box refurbs come in shipping was fast and it came with an android charger block and a no name lightning cablephone came with one long deep scratch a cracked home button and a couple other much smaller nicks and scratches enough that it was off putting for me battery life showed 92 which is excellent however the phone did seem to lag after only my second week with itphone was unlocked as stated and i had no issues switching in my sim and using the phone right away overall a decent phone but i will be returning it because of the the cracked touch id button and deep scratches the phone does not work properly it heats up so hot every time we try and use it gift good condtion a good way to get a new iphone at a good price the battery is useless it takes 3 hours of use to fully recharge needs to be replaced all seemed as expected from the seller and from description except battery life was not 80 or above as stated in listing but 70the biggest issue with this was having to pay send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promisedthis just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending then what else are they not checking with these phones did not come with any kind of paperwork and it is working but the touchscreen can freeze up at times although i was very happy to get a much needed upgrade from my old 5s and this was just the right size there were a couple of things i was not satisfied with and almost sent the phone back first of all amazon stated the battery would be able to be charged at a minimum of 80 its original capacity mine was not it was around 75 i figured ok well i suppose i could live with that but amazon also states that there will be no visible blemishes on the phone viewed from 12 inches that was not the case with mine the finish on one of the rear corners about a half inch the entire corner of the phone was completely wore off once again i decided i could live with that since it is the rear and would be covered with the case overall i am happy with the speed and functionality of the phone though and the screen camera and everything work great i am not happy that i will end up putting another 50 to 100 dollars into a phone that cost me about 200 in order to get a new full capacity battery that lasts longer for media and extended use daughter loves it no fingerprints reader and the phone glitches a lot i was switching phones because the one i was using had a battery that was starting to die however this one does just as quickly and got so hot it almost hurt to hold it i just opened this product and charged it fully for two hours and unplugged it as i am sitting here on my old phone to port over my sim card credentials the battery went from 100 to 88 within 8 minutes i just saw the numbers dropping right before my eyes the phone transfer and condition are really good but the battery is terrible i wish the guarantee included a new battery health is reading at 83 out of the box the phone is very small battery life not as advertised only 56no answer from seller the phone looked good function well but was defective it had something loose inside and i had return it i would definitely buy again this the real deal fr you all should try them out i got my moneys worth the battery life last about 2 to 3 hours great phone defiantly recommend it is a little weird at times like it takes a while to turn on after it dies sometimes and i cannot have certain pictures as my screensaver for some reason it would black out parts of it but i only had that problem with two of my pictures other than that for a refurbished phone it is pretty good i have boughten iphones from amazon before two different iphone 6s this time i could only find iphone 7 so if figured why not i will tell you why this seller sent a defective phone it worked perfectly the first day and then 24 hours later it told me i needed to update it or else my cellular data would not work which means i could not receive or send any texts or calls sure enough i updated it and it worked for another few hours until it said it needed another update unfortunately it was already up to date as it could be so i took it in to the geniuses at apple and they said this is a common problem with iphone 7 you need to replace it and that was it returning hopefully that goes smoothly avoid iphone 7 too sketchy excellent product  \n",

top coats work great for an at home gel manipedi my only issue was when i tried to soak and scrape it off it seemed like the base layer bonded almost too well with my nail and part of my nail layers scraped off i had to take a few months break between the next gel manicure because my nails were damaged this could just be user error or the fact that my nails are extremely thin they held up great though and looked beautiful the product works great the only reason i did not give five stars was because it smells terrible like a skunk almost and it is very strong but it works and works well i would buy it again beats having to use nail polish remover in the end best quality i have ever used at home nails come out looking professional very easy to use i recommend it smells awful while the polish is great every bottle i have ever had from them 4 all have leaked when on their side i love this product it is very easy and it last for 14 days best brand for top coat and base my favorite one terrible product the base coat seemed to work fine but the top coat was in such a gellike consistency that i could not even use it no matter how hard i shook the bottle up it remained the same waste of money only reason i gave it two stars instead of one is because the base coat worked all in all not happy the base coat is horrible you are better off just buying the top coat only top coat is average i would say i have done my manicures without the base and they come out better the base causes the polish to look bumpy really cool that i can do this at home just light and done my top coat bottle came completely empty i am returning for a replacement but it is disappointing poor quality was only good the first few uses base coat became thick and does not go on smoothly at all product quality changes over very short time would not recommend both me and my sister are allergic to this product after some use it causes nail bed pain and inflammation it is great that you take a picture but it helps if you show the door this was dropped off at 104 not 106 i could not get the base coat to dry fully i used my uv light 5 times 5 min and it was still tacky i gave up and went ahead and put polish over it anyway the polish i used thankfully was able to dry just fine the top coat seemed to dry much better but i will not be using this brand again overall this is a good set it can be thick so be sure to wipe the brush on the side of the bottle before applying and when covering your nail make sure to use thinner coats and apply evenly or else you will see the linesuneven levels after curingfor curing times i have a uv led lamp and was not sure how long to cure for top coat 60 seconds is perfect cures hard and comes off easily when time to remove for base coat i tried 60 seconds but was having a hard time when removing it so i went down to 30 seconds and that seems to have helped top coat dried out in the bottle after 3 uses returned perfect bottles came leaking from the top the gel polish i got to go along with these two bottles was perfectly fine and intact why these leaked i do not know i have not used them yet either since most of the product was all over the box it came in top coat goes on nicely and leaves a nice shinny coat and is not sticky pretty easy to come because the polish came off within a week i would have expected it to last at least 2 weeks very small but not too bad nice not that good this product worked amazingly well after a minute under led uv it was dry very sheer and worked well with my polygel kit first time trying this brand and my last very very thin like a refusal polish not hard at all nails broke easily i do not recommend this brand great product amazing lasts the longest out of anything i have tried this is a peel off formula i do follow all the instructions for application and i never use acetone to remove i soak in water for a few minutes or just hand wash some dishes and i am able to peel of the polish most times i one piece now while that its awesome because it removes easily the manicure does not last past 2 days with out major chipping i used it the first time and it worked real good but the second time was horrible i could not get it to set correctly it was in a way clumpy it sucks because i really wanted to like it horrible product does not stay on the top coat has a thick glue like consistency and does not spread on nail well peels off within a couple of days so disappointed is just a oil it is clumpy and did not even dry all the way through now my nails are smudgedestá muy gruesa y no se secaron bien mis youñas i ordered the base top coat about 4 years ago i loved it i started doing my own nails again so i wanted to try it againbad idea the base coat works fine but the top coat started clumping was too thick this was only the first use maybe they have changed the polish since the last time i used it but i will not be ordering it again works fine does not last too long though the base coat good but the top coat is trash starts peeling the next day great base and tip coat lasts atleast 3 weeks for me not even an ounce i have tried various steps in an effort to get this polish to last longer than 7 days it does not matter what i do it chips and looks like crap and has to be changed by day 7 i bought this base and top with amelie gel polish the topcoat got extremely clumpy after the second use causing an unsmooth finish i was super excited to get my gel polishes in with such fantastic ratings unfortunately the product was so thick when i went to apply it applied like a literal paste there is no good use for this polish and i would like a refund promptly i love the no wipe too coat saves me some time this brand does not hold up the shellac peels off a lot sooner then expected seriously soooo good i do my own gel nailstoes at home and this is by far the best set i have gotten gel polish is definitely an art and takes a long time to master if this set lifts you probably just are not doing your gel application correctly these two are excellent also added bonus you do not need to wipe the top coat the item itself is good but the bottles are very very tiny i wish they made them a little bigger for the price this does what it says it will do and the top coat is not sticky at all when it sets the only complaint i have is that if you try to close the bottle when there is polish on the brush and the polish gets onto the mouth of the bottle the cap will actually shrink wrap onto the mouth of the bottle making it very hard to open this has happened to me several times so now i make sure there is no polish on the outside of the mouth of the bottle and i try to close it very gently not tightly please be aware of how you close this nail polish otherwise it will take forever to open when you want to use it again i really loved this product for the first few months but recently began to have an allergic reaction to the product i am bummed i have to switch it up now because its great quality not saying do not buy it but definitely be mindful very good product will buy again applies and cures well but dulls your manicure significantly also the base coat is difficult to remove bought for my sister who does nails and she did not like it sadly i like the product it is a good shine and it lasts about two weeks i was pleased the gel has a murky purple coating during the day time it glows green under uv light when comparing this top coat to my kupa inc top coat there is a huge difference in color kupa inc top coat is clear and the aimeli has the murky purple coating so in love with this gel it is thick and gets into all the nooks and crannies it was actually recommended by a nail tech on you tube nailed by nikki and i had to try so far i am loving this product if you do not like thick gel this is not for you but trudt you will not regret this buy top coat does not wear well base coat works great dislike great base and top coat for gel nails not bad i have ordered it several times wish they would sell a matte top gel with these too i was scared at first because it was still tacky after curing under uv light but i read it is supposed to be so polish will stick continued with my nail routine and it turned out well really great product especially for the price great for beginners works well i brought the polish the size of the bottle for what you pay is pretty small i do not blink your eyes this chips and peels off about like regular nail polish it is nothing like gel nails that you get in the salon which is what i was looking for top coat turns yellow after a few days i have used the base and top coat 4 times so far and every time my nails start turning yellow after a few days i have tried different curing times and even wiped the top coat after but nothing seems to fix it this has never happened with other brands of gel top coat i have used worked pretty good good product for the price i usually get opi but this did the job this was great for the price only issue was it did chip in some nails but that may have been true to operator error i may not have cured the polish long enough all in all i am happy with my purchase also arrived a lot sooner than i had anticipated this i cannot even begin this is an amazing base and top coat my nails lasted it was easy to use and great for gelsi love it this is my first gel base and top coat so i really do not have anything to compare it to this must be a cheaper brand or the base coat is just bad i have been using file off gel polish and i was noticing that i have a problem not damaging my nail when filing it off it was not killing my nails but i figured soak off would case me to do less accidental damagei bought this brand because it was prime available and somewhat inexpensive in a week i have had two nails one on each hand peel completely off its not like the free edge got loose it just was really lifted in the middle or edge where it frowns in and the loose polish would get peeled up to an awkward place where i had to remove it or it would peel even more off the top layer of my nails one happened in just 3 days three days i fixed those two jankity nails and i also added a second coat of just the top coat to all of my nails after 1 week i cannot tell if the top coat is better or notnow this does have a perk its super easy to soak off and remove like wow it removes like butter but if its coming off super easy because it falls off of a well prepped nail in less than a week this is a problem i can now see why this has some lower ratings and why people would spend at least double on a widely known us name brand will i use the rest of teh bottle yes i am cheap i also like changing my nail polish color frequently if i can pull that off this soaks off so easy that i could totally change my polish all the time but it also just falls off which means when i am too busy to do a manicure once a week this just flat out sucksedit i have updated this review because after sitting and soaking off the polish i am really happy with how my nails look they are not damaged or sad looking it really did just bubble up and off this would not be my choice for wearing before going on vacation or trying to wear for weeks in a row since it does not bubble up and come off easily but if you like to change your nail color a couple of times a week you will be happy with this polish88 update i keep trying this basetop coat foolishly because i have it it keeps performing poorly polish just pops off within a day or two of application just spend more and get gelish even with shrinkage at least it stays on the nail better its my own fault for trying it again but good grief peels easy this basecoat is whack upon applying it it is separated like crazy when i applied my gel color over top it also would separate on top until the second or third layer when it evened out the topcoat is great not tacky once it is been cured and works as advertised top coat and base coat is very thick hard to apply thin took forever to cure and was sticky had to put under the led light a lot longer than suggested to cure and then my thumb completely peeled off this is the worst gel i have ever used does not really fully harden peels off not durable at all do not reccommend not good do not buy this this item is a great price for the two bottles and it a product that i like because of the no wipe top coat and it give a nice shiny finish easy to use and has a nice longevity impressed with the quality not so well i used this base and top coat with the gellen polish brand this stuff works great top coat is very glossy and dries fast with the uv lamp like instantly dry i have had these nails for 2 weeks and the gloss wore off a smidge but that is expected after 2 weeks still has not chipped or lost all glossiness i recommended this brand to 2 friends overall great purchase i will be buying the colors next i am reasonably new to gel nails and this was my first set of top and base which i bought as amazon reccommended it i am fully aware of how long it takes to remove gel but this stuff does not come off an hour of working at it every manicure with sandpaper bowls of acetone and wraps and it just does not budge yet it manages to lift along my cuticle line after a week and a half buy something higher quality and experiment with inexpensive gel colors lesson learned i do like this but do not get to close to the sides of your nail it will peel up i can get it to last 7 to 10 days so i guess it is not to bad its not easy to take off unless it is peeling up i am by no means a pro with my nails so it could totally be something that i am doing wrong but for the price it is not a bad product great quality for the price convenient that you do not have to use rubbing alcohol after use my nails stay on really well using the base and top coat used with uv light look nice but the nail polish only last like 4 days liked this product and the cost is fair i have used name brands that have cost more and this brand is equivalent bottles were broken at the cap bottles spilled out the contents was not able to be used very disappointed this is my favorite base top coat set i definitely wish that they made bigger bottles or maybe a refill bottle because i literally have to order a new set every week i go through them too quickly and having the option to just refill my bottle would be so amazing i really like this base top coat but it does leave almost a blue tint to the polish sometimes or it can be streaky i am new to the diy uv lamp this is a must have for uv gel make sure your nails are clean and dry before you put the base coat wiping with alcohol works well would recommend and buy again not a big fan of this the base coat never dries which i know is kind of okay because it is a base coat but overall it just takes forever under the lamp and by that time things like dust get stuck in the polish so it is weird was old really smooth and shiny but it has a really strong smell bought for a friend and she said it is the best she is used this far i will stick to the beetles brand but it is good to know there is an alternative that works well if necessary good this top coat sucks it gets so cloudy and it does not shine i bought this as my first gel base and top coat polish lasted the average two week which was great however no matter how careful i applied it it always left imperfections like it shrinks when it sets up under the light perfect and smooth going on ripples when dried i tried it with many different colorsbrands and always got the same result i will stick to my new favorite cnc shellac perfect every time used it twice by the second time the product had already become a useless gooey substancewaste of money i work whole day and full time mom and this works great lasts 10 days easy to apply received today and not sure if this is oldproduct but i cannot get the top coat bottle open not sure but it is definitely defective you need the no wipe top for any of their polishes i use plenty top coat but this is the worst by far works great pretty nice polish after using this product as instructed i realized that the topcoat comes off way too easy i am not happy with it i do like the builder gel but other than that i do not like this product my base coat takes a longer time to dry other than that will by again love the colors but peels off ez on natural nails this set is really nice and works well for acrylic nails be warned that on natural nails the top coat burns when cured otherwise this product is awesome trash i love the base and top coat the only problem i have had is that the top coat came really lumpy but i have been working through it and just wiping the clumps off as i work but over all they are both great and last i love how it goes oni got so excited i ordered morebut it chips after a few daysam so very disappointed in thatwould not buy againnow that i already have bought it as a result of all them better tthan positive reviews i was not at all disappointed definitely recommended with no reservations long lasting but a few cons the product is very runny so you have to be careful otherwise you will have a lot of clean up around your cuticles to do before curing i did not have issues with peeling or chipping until a couple weeks later so that is a plus the biggest con for me was the removal i am not sure this is really soak off i soak cotton balls in 100 pure acetone and wrap in foil after 40 minutes only the top coat budged a little my gel polish another brand peeled off very easily but underneath the base coat was hard as a rock this is the same thing that happens when i use my regular gel polish top coat and forget that it has to filed off and accidentally soak them i love a good base and top coat but i do not want it to be so thick this product is much thicker than any i have used so far and i had a lot of bubbling on my nail and for these reasons i am passing on future purchases i have been using these for years seems like the formula changed lately less shiny does not have the same look under the led light not sure how it will hold up top coat was clumpy purchased 2 x happened to both top coats the top coat was not going on well i had to replace the top coat with a different brand but i still use the base coat the base coat works quite well difficult to remove it though but after 1 or 2 uses the top coat does not work very well at all it bubbles like crazy leaving a polka dot texture and my nails start chipping after 4 or 5 days of wear would not recommend functionally decent they smell atrocious though more so than any nail product i have smelled in my life acrylic smells better than this stuff it is like burning plastic straight from the bottle needs over 60 seconds under uv to set but that is not a huge deal i do not know what i have been doing wrong if anything but the base coat cures in a weird way it will almost bubble and shrink to one side of my nail i thought it was my technique or lamp but i later found out it was not the case the top coat is pretty solid though so i will keep using that i was so excited about finding a cheaper alternative to the sally hansen brand but the first time i stuck my hands in any water the top coat chipped right off and looked awful also took a long time to cure it is cheap but you should probably just pay a bit more for a better top coat nice gel as expected applies well dries well with my lamp is no wipe my only complaint is that it does not get thick or strong enough this product works for maybe a day or 2 but after that it peels off or chips easily so with that being said it definitely easy to remove lol would recommend just spending the money on a better product that might cost more you will save yourself time i have had these for some time now i do prefer this formula over other brands however after using for a while the outside of the bottles gets extremely sticky there is still plenty of polish left over in the bottle so i hate to throw it away but i might have to replace them because i cannot stand the feeling other than that everything is great just make sure that you keep them upright all the time and be careful when using this is amazing product love this product works great cures in 30secs would recommend 2 anyone who wants stronger lasting nails polish started chipping on day 1 to be fair it may have been the uv lamp i was using because i think it was defective hence the extra 2 stars i love that you do not have to wipe the topcoat but no matter how long i soak my nails the basecoat will not come off i have excellent soak off fingernail polish remover but the basecoat will not come off all of the way i am going to have to sand it off my nails wow this stuff lasts a very long time however it took me 3 separate times of soaking my nails with acetone to remove the top coat at 20 minutes each time i buffed my nails first to scratch it too it might be easier to let the polish grow out the top coat polish keeps its shine for entire time this stuff lasts a long timethe base coat did not even come off so i just buffed it off with my nail filei want to give this a great review the price is so good it is just so darn hard to remove i like the other polish colors but just will use my other brand base and top coats instead polish was awful it was thick and difficult to apply because it did not flow from the brushit globbed i did use the curing lightthinking it might kind of smooth out a bit and it took 45 mins supposed to take one minute to make it seem ok but it never did completely dry huge waste of my money and my time the top coat is amazing i love it the base coat is weird minus a star you have to put a super even coat on the whole nail and it cannot be too thin of a layer because it becomes uneven you have to use just the right amount anyway it makes me wonder if the base coat is even necessary also the base coat does not dry hard after the lamp it is a bit sticky so do not touch it that is supposedly normal though i have mixed feelings about this product the first time i used the polish it was amazing but the next time i used it it was like the top coat was settinghardening on the brush i pulled that clump off and then went on it worked just as the first time but then when i go to use it the 3rd time there is little hard pieces all over the brush the was no sticky film once you cure it under the light i just wish i for more uses out of it rather than looking like 3 i have used many gel polishes but this is the first to do this i may have gotten a bad batch or something i really like the base coat i have had no problem with the my polish coming off of my nail sticky very sticky i do not feel like it is quite as shiney as previous ones i have purchased pretty good once dry there are no problems with chipping or peeling but need to take extra time under the uv lamp i have used two different brand lamps and both take a while to dry so be patient and you have a great polish i have used several different base and top coats but when i used this one it started peeling off after 3 days nice shine but that is a bummer does not stay on really shiny easy to use but for some reasons it turns yellow after a couple days 34 i have been sandwhiching my my old polish with great success lasts over a week i have not waited for it to chip to removei do not notice any funky smell like other reviewersi have to say though the base coat is difficult to remove i have to do a second round of buffing and soaking to get it off and still have to buff of the remnantsps you have to let your nail polish dry before you put on the top coat or it will never dry will buy again leaked everywhere such a mess had to throwaway very disappointed in this product i have used a better top and base coat in the past and repurchased those instead i missed the cut off to return it but i honestly would it did not last more than a week this base coat was unbelievably bad it applied smoothly to freshly washed cleaned nails that had been wiped clean of residue with alcohol then as it cured it drew together into raised rivulets leaving other parts of the nails completely bare it also went spiky with little points all over it that gave it a texture like there was sand mixed in needless to say this did not provide a smooth canvas for my manicure and when two coats of gel polish over it still could not completely smooth it out my only choice was to put a glitter overcoat over everything to camouflage it so unimpressed love love love very easy to apply and the topcoat is amazing week 3 and no chips on my nails i have tried many other products but this is the best highly recommend terriblequality make sure you are sober when you put it on the first it is more difficult than regular polish but it is 100 worth it very great colors and it last a lot longer base is not good top coat does cure pretty quickly but they really do not help the gel stay on longer as my gel chipped the next day was pretty annoyed at that good quality very shiny but to little of product i am glad i bought these but the top coat has been leaking a bit out of the top so it will not last as long as i would like but i still am pretty glad i bought it and the price is not bad either i love this brand these are amazing unlike some name brands this product is too soft and allows your nails to tear and peels off way too easy it is ok i trying better that keep your nail polish on more two day sad i have to do my nails very two days because of product is not good not worth the money excellent base top coat makes my nails really shiny and hard and my polish last for 2 weeks but it does seem to dent if you push your nail or something sharp into it and for that i am removing one start removal is easy too with a 180 grit file i gave it 2 stars because the base coat get hard at all so i order a different kind i hope it works better bad quality i use gel polish that does not require a base coat so i only use the top coat it dries down nice and hard and does not have a sticky finish my biggest complaint is that the top coat almost separates and does not provide an even finish does the job for the most part  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                i was not impressed with the image quality also the app that was suggested to use my phone as a remote for it did not work properly biggest pain to attach to a helmet but works well otherwise the only thing about the camera was that i had no clue it was so small we enjoy using this camera to get a canine view of our dogs activities it fits well into their harness and we get to see them running swimming and playing there are a large number of function and features so reading the instructions is a must especially to take full advantage of the power of this camera it holds up well to use we have had no problems with it in several months would definitely purchase again not a good purchase this camera works as advertised and video quality is more than i expected great features for the price the adhesive in some of the mounts could be better i wish they had special mount for ski helmets this is a 12 megapixel camera with 4k video waterproof case is good and numerous attachments for mounts are included photo quality is less than average compared to my iphone 6s and i can not get videos to play at all overall i would spend a few extra dollars and buy a better platform to capture life with i bought this as a gift for my son we have not had a chance to use it just yet the only issue i have had was inserting the sd memory card something seemed to be wrong with the slot it would not stay inserted all the way in it seemed it was engaged like it already had a card in the slot after some time i did manage to get it in correctly we did do a practice video and took a picture it has nice quality we cannot wait until the weather warms more to try it out bought this for my 9 year old son several months ago it has been great glad we bought it high quality for the reasonable price and a tough little camera it is holding up well no negatives i can think of works well with phone app glad i did not spend the extra money for gp no need this thing does it all lots of videos on youtube comparing the two see for yourself does not always stay oni use it as a dash camera the wifi system sucks on this camera and the app it requires you to use keep crashing i found another use for the camera but i would never by this camera again i love this camera works wonders for dirt bike trail riding and capturing sea life under water product shipped fast seems like a great camera so far just recently started using so not sure how to rate long term yet audio does not pick up well in the protective case but the video is great we are still learning to use it but the grandkids have fun recording things i got this for my husband for a gift the app did not seem to work well with his motorola phone sinking issues and gave up on it he has recently uodated to a new samsung galaxy 10 so hopefully will be able to get it to work wit good price but takes terrible videos it is not worth the time to even save these videos look at the videos on the feedback i do not know why people think this is a good camera do not waste your time very difficult to figure out what parts go to what and what they are used for if you give them a good review they will give you another accessory that you will have no idea how to use no instruction manual included i guess you get what you pay for i should have checked youtube before purchasing this got it today returning tomorrow so far i am impressed with this product one things for sure no matter what you plan on mounting it to there is an accessory included to do so i have only had it for a day but so far so good does not upload to your computer hard to work this little cam is really good i went to the bahamas last week and took many under water videos and photos and this camera work like a dream just remember to put in a high speed micro sd card not included i absolutely love this and i have recommended it to all of my friends i would definitely purchase this again thank you no way that this is 12mp no way also and this was the main reason why i returned it the batteries lasted less than half an hour on a full charge and for some reason the only way i could have turned on the camera was if i removed the battery from its compartment and reinsert it product works very well i use it for fishing and nature hikes taking videos hands free is a big advantage i was impressed with all of the attachment accessoriesexcellent value while the picture is great it appears that you have to set the date and time every time you change the battery i have not found anything in the manual that will save the date and time permanently which is unacceptable well i just found it 11 it says if you replace the battery date and time will reset wt disappointing did not even work for 30mins in the water and stop working do not waste your money updated reviewsupport to the win after seeing this review the manufacturer emailed me back and sent me 2 new batteries no charge and both were timed by filming a clock lol and both did about 2hrs of run time of course i ran this once on each once summer comes i will pull out the helmet cam and go riding and push the camera to the limit advice be sure to keep the camera outside of the waterpoof case if your riding in the heat it gets hot with those batteries thanks akaso for the follow uporiginal reviewi purchased this for my mtn bike rides and well it works nice but if you like having to try and time yourself on the trail and at 20 min per battery and only have 2 batteries than well go for it its a nice toy otherwise ya pay for what you get the quality of the camera is about what you would expect for 60 it works exceptionally well in brightly lit areas like the outdoors and it also has a wide variety of attachments that make it great for whatever activity you plan on documenting such as hiking water sports or skatingit is a great entry camera for people who are interested in getting involved with filmography so i bought this item last year for a xmas gift and we are now just being able to use it and the cord does not charge the battery works great for its price as well as wrist watch works with simonides cameras as well great product great battery life lots of ways to use this camera ordered this thinking it would b great to b able to video our hunting dogs we were surprise at all the features it offered must download the instructions and read carefully in order to get the best use from camera gave to grandchild loves to show what he does would not work for half my trip bought a memory card for it that was ment for the device kept saying card in validbatterys lasted about an 1hr have not had a chance to give a performance test of it the box ship in was way to small for the item and it could have lucky it did not get damaged so right now only can say packaging was not good will see later this week if camera is any good it seems like a good camera i have only used it in the pool so far i will not do scuba diving with it until junethe instructins are very lacking so it makes it much harder to figure out how to usealso i thought it had way to many extra parts that i will never use very very complicated it will take a while to figure out after opening the box and trying to figure it all out with no so hot directions and diagrams i gave up and gave it to a friends son who has more experience with the tech so many pieces and it was just not worth it for me i never even got it working so i cannot judge the camera at all so if you are into high tech camera stuff it might be great average user not so much it is not a bad unit if you are not willing to spend the money on the higher quality cameras bought it for hunting but it is hard to use in a pinch no comparison to the gopronot many features no zooming capabilities i guess you get what you pay forupdate since posting the above i was contacted by akaso and offered a partial refund which i received immediately once i agreed to it very good customer service camera shoots video really well for the price however the app that goes with it is garbage this is a good value camera we use for family events great price for an action cam it is a solid camera pictures are ok but they look better on my phone the batteries die pretty quick i bought this as a second action cam to use for a different angle the reviews i saw made it look impressive my main camera is a gopro hero 4 so the video and audio quality just does not compare if you were using 2 or 3 of these you could get by ok but this one just cannot begin to keep up it is kind of like a volkswagen and a ferrari having a raceone handy item with it that i did not think i would use in the remote control for videos i just do not see much use but for snapping a picture it does ok not what i expected did not like that it was not compatible with my laptop or my android phone i needed a mac computer or video editor to down load my videos fell off my motorcycle and broke and pieces first time out never got to use it this product never worked i took two videos and then it stopped turning on being the only camera i took on my trip to egypt i was very dissapointed takes amazing still shots at 60 fps while traveling at 55 mph do not buy this if you are mounting it to anything that goes down the road instead spend a few dollars more and get the brave 4 which is the upgrade to this model which includes image stabilization i cannot report yet on how good that feature is on the other camera having bought it to replace this one however this one creates unwatchable video at least mounted to a motorcycle the image shudder is horrendous you see some four different layers of the horizon jumbled together when playing back the video on the computer on this lower model the remote required the camera to be active for the two buttons to work they do not turn the camera on they do not stay lit as an indicator on the back the lcd is nice but to determine which mode is active you have to look closely for the white camera icon to go red when recording when taking a snapshot the screen flickers and resets to the camera non recording mode i used this flickering indicator to know if the camera was recording while looking through a tinted windshield where its mounted on the front of my bikethe upper model seems to have addressed some of these concerns for the better i will have to review it once i get out on the bike and test it there is yet another model that is even higher priced than the brave 4 that one s you tuber claimed had real 4k and not digitally processed 4k like these two lower models if that is a concern i had no complaint with the still frame on this camera at speed set to 60fps even if it is not true 4k this arrived with the plastic part that holds the camera to the handle broken it worked for the first couple of days then the charging became iffy to the point where i had to hold the cable titled for it to charge then the next day the usb port fell inward into the unit and it could no longer charge the failure of the usb port after only a couple uses indicates that the manufacturing of this product is inferior the camera was returned used it 4 times and now it does not work i hope the added warranty is better than the camera i bought this camera to help record a ski trip with my kids the biggest negative i have for it is that the camera is not waterproof i could not get any audio with the camera because it was stuck inside a waterproof case the whole time the worst part is the case got scratched on the lense so now i cannot use the case and cannot seem to find a replacement do not do it my husband and i got this for our cruise and the sd card would not go in the camera it is like a piece was blocking it from going in so we could not use it at all tried to get in contact and nothing spend the extra money for name brand of this is what off brand is like i appreciate the quality of this product just received this yesterday i have downloaded to apps in order to get videos one says it download once you go to it you can only hear it the other one let us you download it but cannot share it anywhere because it is only the sound as well you need a better app for people who only have phones to use i am going to try a couple more things but so far not really that great because of the app if someone could let me know what they use for their phone that would be great thanks positive product is cheap compare with others in the market image and video quality are okaynegative wifi features along with app connectivity are bad disconnects for no reason and is hard to manage sometime it will disconnect from the app but you could not work with it manually unless you give it a hard reset disconnect the battery if you want better quality and connection i suggest you go with a gopro this item have been open before arriving to me it box was without its brand new warranty seal it is very shame why is happening it it is lack of respect to the costumer please very poor quality overall picture sound stabilization are all not very good after reading the other reviews that were positive i do not know if i even had the sam camera used it for a few hours and tried to be positive after that i returned it and got a go pro and i am so much happier this camera came with so many amazing features and accessories i love how great the underwater camera quality is and that it comes with two rechargeable batteries instead of constantly buying new batteries it is super easy to use my 4year old can even operate it in the pool definitely recommend my wife and i really liked it for this price to be able to get a solid camera was really clutch we went on a trip to dr and used it for a variety of adventures and i am no camera guru at all cannot wait to try it for extreme uses used camera in and out of water works great the handle on camera needs to be longer to help stabilize the camera shot use this for my motorcycle it does the job for cheap if you are looking for an action cam 1 thing i would advise is to stock up on extra batteries my daily commute is approximately 20 minutes and when i arrive battery is near empty already maybe it is my settings not bad just expecting a bit more it works great sound is quiet if not connected to the ismart dv app battery life last less than 90 minutes screen turns black when you are recording so you cannot see what you are filming i would not recommend it i thought it was good at first but for longevity it is not worth it if you only plan to do 30 minutes between charges then it is right for you i am very happy with this camera it comes with two rechargeable batteries several mounts and a waterproof case for underwater footage i picked this up for an up and coming trip as my primary camera failed after about 17 years canon i realize this is not expected to perform on still photos as well as an slr but i figured it would do as well as my cheap phone it does not still photos are blurred no matter how they are taken if you use them for thumbnails they are fine but if you plan to take stills of your trips do not use this as you will be very disappointed the remote works the water proof case is more like water resistant on the low end drop it in the tub its not going to protect your camera in my testing also the accessories everyone raves about almost all of them are useless outside buying more parts they have a pamphlet that comes with the device you have to register to get the good stuff i refuse to do this because it means more spam it borders on misleading anyhow good low end cheap and second camera ok for primary action video but nothing to write home about good camera for price def worth it just wish batterys lasted longer ok here is my review i have loved the camera for since i purchased it and have taken many beautiful videos however i just discovered that there is really no way of editing it i am not sure why that is i expected it to be just as easy to edit it as a go pro but it is not so if you want to just look at the videos that you shoot without editing them it is a good camera takes great pictures but for me without the ability to edit it is basically worthless i downloaded about 6 different editing software apps on my phone and none of them will recognize the video file it would be nice if the company that makes these cameras addressed this issue price is awesome will not give me a heartattack in case i lost it while having outdoor activities camera is small and light enough to be attached to wrist camera is waterproof and operates well in water images and videos are stable and good quality for this price it served us well in a recent rafting trip to yellowstone and more ski trips in the winter the camara stop recording for not reason and when it was recording you can not watch all the videos only a few and the others video shows error my son and i started using the akaso ek7000 4k wifi sports action camera ultra hd waterproof dv camcorder 12mp 170 degree wide angle yesterday and he had an absolute blast with it picture quality was great unfortunately as we were charging it this morning the charging port pushed directly into the camera and was shaking around inside we were able to unscrew the front of the camera and remove the charging port it looks like it was only attached with two small tack welds i emailed the company through amazon but amazon responded that there is an issue with the email address the company provided i did not expect this camera to last forever but i did expect the charging port to last more than 24 hours the camera has one of the worst picture and sound quality i have seen our gopro got water in it and ruined so we wanted a replacement without spending so much money this is the same size as a gopropretty good quality video it came with 2 rechargeable batteries we also got the accessories which are a good cost and have so many options if you do not want to spend a lot of money this is a great option for you it is works great my only problem with it is that i was recording a thing for my school and it would suddenly freeze and the only way to fix it was to take out the battery apon further inspection it would freeze whenever shaken too harshly finally got to use my camera on a scuba dive but did not really use it because it leaked and is now not in my return window super disappointed this camera has ok image quality it has a short battery life when recording only about 1 hour it does not come with a memory cardrated 3 stars because of the short recording time battery life image quality for the money was good image stabilization not good good camera for the money this camera ruined my motorcycle trip to morocco i was hopeing to get some footage of my motorcycle trip this camera would not work for me it continually froze and would become unresponsive after less than 5 minutes of operation nice little action cam for the price takes good video sound is not the best really really poor camera and sound quality waste of money to be honest bought to record vacation memories and aircraft takeoffs and landings the sound quality is the worst the video quality is just ok this is a case where you see 4k and think its going to be great then you get it and its just ok it is a small camera and i like that i can take it with me wherever i go if i need it i like the battery and is easy to take pictures and video but i do not like too much the picture quality and color balance all depends how you want to use it unfortunately i have not been able to use this camera but twice the battery says charged but when i unplug from the power source it shuts off the buttons are confusing manual was no help i was really excited to get and use this camera for my horse back riding but guess i will look for something else this is a great alternative to trendy gopro cameras it has all the features the kids are looking for for sport videos and more good amount of accessories and quality seems as good as the gopro not a bad camera just not was i was expecting having a gopro this does not really compare after 3 weeks it stopped working i returned it for a full refund and got myself a gopro hero 5 it is working well and longer than this camera i would have kept it had it continued to work i actually bought 2 i am changing my original 4 stars to just 2 the quality of the videos i shot and downloaded are very poor not the quality of my work but from the camera from both cameras when i first noticed i went and shot with the other camera same thing it is very disappointing you get what you pay for video is extremely jumpy picture does not even seem to be 720p if you want to record your bike rides this camera is not a good choice it does not have any image stabilization image is not clear not 4k this camera is easy to use and takes really good clear pictures i have used this during hunts and for other random things great camera before i could use it for the third time the clip that holds the buttons in place the one for the power came off no it is useless under water or in salt air conditions not happy at all it was a week old at best a little shakey when running but overall it is a nice camera for the price great videos but the battery life is goes quickly the battery did not last very long a couple hours at most the plus side is the camera comes with two rechargeable batteries so i was able to replace it when it died video quality was good picture quality left much to be desired i could have taken better pictures on my phone sound is almost nonexistent when in the water proof case it comes with many accessories that i could not figure out and the manual was no help tons of accessories but not one selfie stick which is really what we wanted i bought this for a trip to kauai and it served its purpose if you are looking for an affordable option for a vacation i recommend buying this camera if you are looking to get more usage than one trip i would recommend investing in a better camera great color but battery only lasts about 30 minutes quality seems very solid has gone on a few kayaking trips so far and the waterproofing is up to the job video quality is really good although i will admit i have not spent any time testing its limits as far as fast action or low light conditions i will probably buy a few more i have a gen 1 gopro hero and this easily meets the same quality plus more features just check the video for yourself this is a recording of the audiovideo sync test available on youtube that i recorded just minutes ago i have emailed akaso support i will provide an update once i hear back the charging port no longer works seems the fins in the actual port bent over great value on the dollar got this for a trip to the usvi and got some great moments with it this does not include a needed micro card i purchased this item thinking it would be a bargain deal that is comparable to gopro they are incomparable and i wished i would have spent a little extra for a much better quality gopro like how portable it is yet provides great quality videos great for the price however it only takes good video and pictures in high light low light settings look terrible definitely not 1080 p video quality is very poor cannot be use for anything proper phone take a better video just bought this for my daughters birthday she will be using this on our vacation this summer i bought this camera as a good alternative to the name brand rival that is 5 times the cost figured what do i have to lose it is only 75 i was actually pleasantly suprised that the video quality above and under water is really good then i downloaded the software from the app store and was wondering why it has so many bad reviews and barely a 2 star rating after installing it i attempted to transfer some of my videos from the camera to my phone and the app would crash on any video that is longer then 1 minute in length also the downloaded videos remain with in the app and cannot be saved to your stream in conclusion the iphone app is very poor quality and if you do not mind removing the sd card to copy the video to your computer then this camera is a good buy otherwise if you want to use the app on your phone and to transfer the video footage to your phone over wifi i would not recommend this camera or this brand image quality and stabilization is bad returning the product does not work properly as expected some time it turns on some time it does not battery were fully charge this item sucks really easy set up works great i used it in my car to capture the back roads and the battery life is a lot shorter than another action camera used it once ride and returned it just because of battery life nice action cam but they could do better no stabilization at all no instructions included but did come with a good bit of attachments it is okay i bought a memory card when i video the screen blacks out after a min there were bubbles on the screen when i opened it i liked the camera and had good picture unfortunately the cover of my battery broke and now i cannot

the keyboard being backlit pretty pissed about that considering it the reason i chose this laptop over others i was looking at otherwise it works fine for the basic little wprd processor i use it for also not a cool design like any online description of the model this one is straight flat black incredibly plainlooking and one of my keys is at a wonky angle but it works considering the ither asus products i own this one falls short honestlyif you want to take it out of s mode go to activation and choose to change your edition to regular windows home its a free switch works goodbut the keyboard is not backlitgood buy if you do not need a backlit keyboard i love how light weight and compact it is and the numeric pad as well so far i am pretty happy and content with it i ordered this small laptop for work purposes and general office operations so far it is been well worth the money i took it out of windows s mode it struggled lagged a bit with chrome so i resorted to using the microsoft internet browser but it is been fine and since i only use it for work general office stuff it is done everything that i could have askedthus far the number dial is pretty accurate sleek design and very lightweight perfect product for the average commuter if you feel that you need the trifling advantage of the easy access numberpad go ahead and buy this one if you do not avoid this oneit is a constant annoyance think you can permanently disable the numberpad good luck with that amazing product it is small do you can easily carry it around with no extra weight for 190 bucks this is perfect i think tablets are very overrated i only like touchscreens on a phone this computer is the size of a tablet incredibly light i just wanted something to do my financial stuff email shop and casually browse the internet i do not watch movies on my computer but it plays you tube type videos just fine sound is a little weak but if i want to listen to music i can cast it to my stereo what i like best is the size and weight small and light and it seems to be built solid i charge it at night and use it off and on all day and there is plenty of juice left i could probably charge it every other night if i wanted i have only had it a couple weeks but i feel very good about my purchase screen was good but touch screen suckedthe lol mouse would disappear from screen and just pop up anywhere and would not click on items the 1st clickit takes multiple clicks to get to where i am trying to go it is perfect for my personal use and easy to navigate light weight and fits into my bag to carry with me i like the size and for the price it is worth buying small compact and convenient stay away from windows 10 s let me tell you what it is trash you cannot download anything from browser unless is from their crappy app store i could not download sketchup this is the worst part you cannot use google like what the f they only allow you to use bing who in the right mind uses that search engine no oneeee you have to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to windows 10 pro to be able to use your brand new computer like a normal person would like to do very very disappointed with this stupid windows 10s upgrade not even an upgrade please do your self a favor and buy a mac my wife bought this for email and facebook essentially i had to uninstall the windows 10s features because it kept freezing on the screen that said only approved windows 10 s apps would workthis warning came up randomly even though the only apps on the laptop were from the microsoft app storefinally i said ok no more windows 10s and dropped it in favor of plain windows 10 since that time there has been no problem and no discernible detriment to the function it is very small so be advised if this is a concern 07242021 being

resolution and refresh rates i just wanted something simple to use for files and meetings however the webcam is awful the image is poor quality and if you move at all you will be one big blur so i will need to buy a separate webcam to use the key clicks are loud as you type and although the number pad on the mouse pad is a nifty option it will come on and off when you do not intend it to overall not bad for the price but the high rating seems to be misleading not sure how much i trust amazon reviews at this point i saw no mention of the poor quality webcam and that was one thing i noticed right off the bat considering how prevalent zoom is nowadays worked great out of the box but would not turn on the next day shame as it was perfect for my needs quit working after a week it has m2 which supports nvme ssdsoldered ram works pretty fine to me i buy it for my daughter and it have all thing that she needs perhaps i goofed or something but even a live boot would not take it is not user friendly well worth the price small long battery life enough capability to support remote learning cheap chinese garbage so far the l210 slim laptop is good for working on projects and would make a great investment for a highschool or college grade laptop had to make a couple adjustments like uninstall the graphics driver and install the intel one because graphics problems with chrome as well as in chrome disable the use hardware acceleration when available setting because of graphics errors caused the other adjustment made was creating my own power plan because with the one that comes premade for it does not do the laptop much justice basic power plan was 46 hours on battery but with a well setup plan have it setup it can do 610 hours with videos and 1012 hours on everything else from browsing web to having multiple programs running some stuff you should know is the graphics is 2gb which can handle 1080 videos easy depending on your internet speed 4gb of ram and barely any is actually used unless you have alot of programs running at once the processor says 12ghz dual core but the speeds that have been running are 184ghz so far depending on what is running does not get too hot when running games or videos so will not get burns when sitting a your lap 1 thing though is that it is listed as having a backlit keyboard but it does not have one after dealing with windows updates and driver updates there is around 2025 gb left of space available so if you decide to buy one of these laptops make sure to get a micro sd card for it so you can expand the space and i recommend 120500 gig works good fast light weight outside of the mouse pad i like it a lot it is been more than a month since i got mine and about 3 weeks in the touch pad stopped working trying getting it fixed by a technician who wants an arm and a leg to fix it i am not a fan of using a mouse so disappointment is an understatement at this stage remember you get what you pay for very slow but for paying bills and very light gaming it is serviceable initially i thought i would gotten one of those rare deals something fairly good for a lower price i was being optimistic1 screen saver does not work2 when in sleep you cannot always get the computer to wake up you have to reboot3 applications lock randomly chrome excel etc initially thought it happened after the laptop had been idle for awhile but it happens randomly at any time even when in use some or all apps become lockedunresponsive and you have to closerestart them4 this is more a personal gripe the sound quality is very poor but again it is a low end computer so it really should be expected i just did not expect the sound to be this badon the plus side 1 it is fairly fast and boots quickly the picture description says backlit keyboard but it is not whomever designed the website for asus should be fired i went through a big hassle trying to find an asus laptop that actually had the backlit keyboard that was advertised on several of their models but did not have it i wound up buying an asus 14 laptop that actually had the advertised backlit keyboard from office depotoffice max i had them verify it before i bought it usps delivered this today big box with a fairly big box and padding in it with a small and light laptop in that i had it unpacked and charging in no timesince i never intended to ever use the win10 installed on it or even boot it it took a bit to figure out how to get into the computer settings so that i could boot from a usb drive that i had linux mint installer loaded ona word of caution for those that are going to install linux the current popular install isos do not have the drivers for the wifi chip the drivers will have to be installed manually bluetooth does however work and i was easily able to link this computer to my iphone and get out to the internet that waywork a round i ordered a cheap 20 tp link usb 80211n only 25ghz wifi adapter plugged it in and it just works maybe someday linux will have drivers for the built in wifi chip in this devicewhile the only cpus that intel makes that are crapper than a celeron is a atom i found this on the webthe intel celeron n4020 is one of the most budgetfriendly and powerefficient laptop processors as for gaming the intel uhd 600 graphics of the celeron n4020 is one of the weakest solutions it can be used only for the lightest gamesto sum up the above it is a very cheap and uses very little powerfor its size the keyboard and screen are ok the keys have good travel it has a matte screenthis is a small and very light computer it is snappy enough surfing the web and running linux native applications while i am not clear on this but it appears that it can be charged with a standard usbc chargeri will have to take it out in the wild to see how the battery life holds up on it running linux the battery should last as least as long or longer than it does while running win10 i bought this laptop to use for leisure travel this next year wanted something bigger and more useful than the tablet i currently have while i have just started the setup process ie loading my apps files etc it is doing exactly what i wanted it to do i have switched to windows home installed all my apps and it is currently updating windows it is showing lots of promise this was a major selling feature for me since i work nights description needs updated it is fine otherwise but the trac pad stopped working a few days after we started using it recieved yesterdaystill reading info on using micro soft i am use to google use but this lap top has much more to offer it will take time to get use to it purchased this laptop in march 2021 and it only lasted six months with light use one day i could no longer connect to the internet ran the troubleshooter and it said it could not find a network adapter tried everything suggested but still cannot connect to the internet total waste of money i am giving this tablet two stars as it is inexpensive under 200 and lightweight other than that i would give it one star i should have read the description more carefully as it is not a touchscreen model get your fingers to work on the touchpad if hard enough but the way this was designed if you are not very careful you are constantly turning on the numbering feature it is a serious stupid design you have all the number above the alpha keys grab a calculator if you need it i waited too long on return it excellent for just information support for your job 365 micro soft is useless for the price you cannot complain it works for basic usage as browsing the internet i would recommend for anyone who needs a laptop with basic functionality easy to use up in a second i love it then i realized that i could not hear a damn thing i am on a computer 12 hours a day i know how to work them i adjusted the controlsblah blah could barely hear the volume on some things particularly youtube finally looked and lo and behold the speaker are on the bottom how in the hell can speakers project when you have the danged thing in your lap my thighs completely block all sound so in order to hear certain things i have to hold it up to my face yes i have trouble shooted everything yes i know what i am doing and yes i am sending it back sound sucks and i do not want to have a little speaker attached to the top so i can hear perfect for what it has been designed for internet browsing music playing videos can play terraria arrived without windows bootingupon boot enter bios and i get no bootable device you can tell the manual has been beat up when filling in return on amazon i find support phone number but despite being advertised as open nobody answers i dislike the confusion with it is programs not one to be a refresher onafter so many yearsi feel i made a mistake with choosing this laptop is smaller but has everything you need for school and very light so easy to travel with overall good computer for price sound stopped working completely after a week it will not turn on after having it led than 30 days what i expected it is cute and quiet but the screen is made in a way that you have to look at it at a certain angle or it feels weird on your eyes and only the center circle is bright while the edges appear dark i have never hated a laptop screen so much it is almost like it has a privacy screen on it well it really was not what i was looking for it is kind of slow and i really could not get too many good apps on it and it seems much smaller than what it is size is supposed to be i wanted this laptop to do only one thing act as the control for a label printer but it could not even do that it took forever to boot and everyday tasks kept crashing it totally useless i returned it as soon as i could get it to shutdown this computer was a great purchase for my son he likes to play roblox minecraft and steam games this computer has the capability and speed to play these games and plenty of room to hold them it is not a gaming computer but is capable of playing these games without too much lag time the touchpad that moves the mouse icon does like to stop responding to touch but simply press the f6 key to toggle it back on and off and it will start working or plug in a mouse the battery lasts an extremely long amount of time the display is very clear and good quality excellent product for the price the seller lucky trading has excellent customer service and was very helpful with communication and when i needed product support highly recommended i only needed the computer for zoom whenever i touched the mic i had to hit it several times to turn on mic to speak it was a pain so i returned the computer i prefer touch screen a larger screen it took about ten minutes to download google chrome and when it did simply opening a new tab on the app took at least two minutes for it to fully load i bought this laptop to use for writing and schoolwork but the speed was just unbearable much smaller than i imagine but was ok easy to carry around fast enough for my use dislike nothing i use it for work l like that it was easy to use it is a laptop and it does laptop things if you need it to do heavy intensive things it might not do the thingsbut if you keep your expectations low you will probably not be disappointed the size and range of motion is pretty cooledit the family safety automatically being turned on is irritating the dumbest thing i have ever seen i have taken some mins to set the computer up i do not want to spend more time screen might put some people off battery is phenomenal it is silent and the audio is fine perfect for on the go  \n",
       "4  bought for school work doing good so farsleek it is alright i bought this laptop a week ago the touch pad worked at first once i upgraded windows 10 the touch pad stopped working i went to the acer site to download a new driver for this pos of course it did not work that is why i am giving this a bad review i have tried several things to fix this laptop none of them worked my son loves his laptop one of his favorite devices so far one suggestion by memory card to go along with this laptop i purchased this for my online college classes and am so glad i did awesome product this computer has totally inadequate volume the return was readily accepted by the seller but when i actually took the computer into the ups store i had to pay 21 to have it shipped with the properly printed return label never had to pay to return an amazon purchase before what a ripoff best laptop for this price 5 star i love everything about this laptop horribly horrible computer do not buy screen went out in less than a week only used it once or twice before it went to h e double hockey sticks to the trackpad has scrapes in it when i got it returned it it is been two weeks and i am being told it will take another 2 weeks for my refund to process the body is also thin plastic and not metal like some other aspire 7s including the trackpad get another gaming laptop the rog zephyrus g14 is on sale at best buy right now for almost the same price with a better gpu cpu and an all aluminum chassis basically the one thing that turned me off is that it warns you not to download the google browser because it may make it unstable this will be my last acer i expect notebooks to last around 3 years and that is when you actually use it i used this one as a spare and hardly used it at all in fact i just found it does not even have a battery that you can take out i would not recommend this product great little laptop performs well i do mostly work on it microsoft office audio editing on audacity minor video editing and some music composition with sibelius and it runs flawlessly occasionally i travel and play games on it league of legends and world of warcraft and it runs those just fine too wow on lower graphics settings only down side to this machine is there is very little memory make absolutely sure you budget for cloud storage or an external hard drive if you go with this machine not nearly enough ram slows up with just basic web browsing this is a great laptop for the price but the worst thing about it is the placement of the touchpad it is on the left hand side below the keyboard which makes no sense it should be centered or more on the rightthe screen color is also a bit bright so if you want to edit photos on here beware of that also this thing is kind of heavy this is not bad but i would not buy it again the speakers are horrible and under the computer making it hard to hear i am deaf and you have to pick up the computer to hear them the cap lock key does not a light on it let you know it is on drives me crazy no cd rom either love this laptop except why would you put the speakers on the bottom which makes the sound horrible at least make the max volume higher so you can at least hear without needing external speakers initially once i set everything up i was pretty pleased with my purchase but after a little over a month and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month the screen went black but the backlight on the keyboard was still on so i figured it just needed to be charged i left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it still lit keys but no screen so i changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more came back to it same thing i tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference i never took it out of s mode and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs basically just checked my email a few times now when i plug it in nothing lights up the adapter on the charger does not have any indicator light to show that it is working so it could be a faulty power cordi am going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers but in any case a brand new device should last longer than a monthnow my return window has closed so i am either stuck with a 350 paperweight or i will have to search online and buy a new charger and hope that works i do not spend a lot of time on the computer i purchased the computer so i could do some personal writing i like the fact that it had microsoft office installed i did not like the the restriction to only use apps provided through the microsoft store to download other apps like zoom i had to disable the microsoft security system which cannot now be reactivated on my machine but as far as general use of the computer it has been great unfortunately i have to write a bad review on this one i have babied this laptop and while it was a decent for cheap laptop i cannot believe it just died on me after 14 months i did not get a warranty because the price was more than half of the laptop costagain inexpensive laptop i expect slow etc but not death easy to set up liked the keyboard i added another 4 gb memory just a nice overall laptop it is a lot smaller screen keyboard etc than i had before though i had an acer aspire before i do not like it probably will return it and would not recomment it for older people nice laptop for the money i still do not like windows battery life is lousy my lab top has quit working it will not restart it is froze my mouse will not work it will not let me do anything for the price point its a great laptop first i added another 2gb ram for under 20 and upgraded before i start with the positive one big negative when the laptop goes to sleep mode it take 2540 sec before it wakes up it is very strange its not a traditional hard drive i did not change any settings i have to hit the power button and literally sit there for it to turn on pretty annoying other than that screen quality is phenomenal speed is more than adequate for ms office apps it can also handle streaming and 810 browsers at a time for school work anything non hardcore this is a good laptop sound quality i aways use my bluetooth headset anyway sound is bit more towards the stereo sound i am sure that can be adjusted just havnt played with itlike others have said you cannot go wrong at this price point i just hope it lasts and do not bog down or slow down with updates and what not this laptop is giving me nightmares the touchpad is super sensitive to accidentally turning off ok fine restart and it is back to normal if nothing else works forgetting the inconvenience then this morning after an update to windows 10 the touchpad is not simply off it is not in settings there are no drivers it is just effing gone so here i am using a mouse i hate because the laptop basically does not work as a laptop take into consideration when thinking about purchasing this model it is cheap yes but if you actually need to use on the go or in your lap it is a bad choice i purchased this laptop for general purposes as well as using the cricut desgin space for my cricut machine my old laptop was just running too slowly and i needed an upgrade first off the price is amazing and i am fully aware that you get what you paid for but i feel like i got more than i paid for with this i do not know much about specs and the ins and outs of computers so here are some pros and cons from a general userpros the look and design is very very sleek fairly lightweight the screen resolution amazing it seems fast so far the battery life is very good i have been working continuously for about three hours now without it plugged in and i still have 14 battery life left it does come downloaded with windows 10 s mode however there is literally a sticker directly on the box directing you to a website that explains a stupidly easy four step process to permanently get out of s mode it was the first thing i did based on other reviews and have no issues it was free to do and took 2 minutescons caps locknum lock do not have an indicator light i am already finding this very annoying but i use a usb keyboard most of the time anyway so it is fine the sound is awful if you are using this laptop for streaming games etc you will need headphones no seriously it is really bad the quality is okay but it does not get loud at alloverall with a couple of days of use i am impressed with this purchase as soon as possible if you are looking for an affordable general use laptop i bought this laptop for my wife for her job i wanted something not pricey and just something that worked i saw the high amount of five star reviews and i read through some of the lower starred reviews and thought that will not happen to me bsfirst of all the computer got shipped quickly and got here undamaged but that is the only good i can say about it the backlight for the keyboard goes off quickly and you have to press a key to turn it back on instead of moving the mouse and you cannot change it as you may have read in other reviews the computer comes with windows 10 s mode installed but my product key is not genuine it says that the digital license is not valid because of this it will not activate windows which means i cannot take it out of s mode if the computer is in s mode then you cannot download any apps or programs that you would normally use like mozilla or vlc or even chrome and furthermore you cannot access the command prompt which means you cannot even activate the windows even if you wanted toi have contacted microsoft who told me that they could not do anything and to contact acer i contacted acer and they told me to try one single thing which i already did and confirmed that it does not work then told me i had to send in the laptop to the techs which would take another two weeks just to get it backsooooooooooooooooo long story short it is a never ending loop of disappointment anger and resentment and a complete waste of time and money do not buy save yourself the trouble this laptop was overpriced screen quality is decenttouch screen not reallythis is not a gaming laptopturn off the wifi so it does not interfere with your cell phones connectivity or other tabletcomputer overall a great laptop for the price i added 8g of ram really easily it is fast and cheap however some technical issues s mode is horrible got rid of it immediately my powerpoint screen recording function would not work called microsoft and they were very helpful they rolled back my display driver to microsoft basic and worked perfectly but then the computer would not recognize my second screen called acer and they told me they did not have another display driver to download and referred me to a third party answers by that wanted to charge me 99 to fix the issue for some reason the internet was really slow played with two different routers i had it was still slow even with a triband router and no other devices connected to the internet then i connected to the guest wifi i had set up and it worked perfectly i suspect this may be a driversoftware issuefor the price it is hard to beat this but get ready for some compatibility issues and no support from acer this pc was good but the camera did not work i opened case they could not fis it poor product support dod not buy this pc do not buy this pc very poor support from amazon and acer product would not work out of the box and after an hour with tech support made the decision to return i love everything about this laptop especially the built in alexa it is so sleek and stylish my daughter told me it looked just like her mac laptop best buy anywhere for a laptop at a reasonable price with all the features arrived late speaker volume is lowgreat lt for price will not find anywhere else stopped working after 4 months of light use the first time i attempted to use my webcam for a important zoom interview it would not work after acer did hours of trouble shooting with no resolve they told me i had no other choice but to reset my laptop to factory settings which meant i lost almost everything i had on my laptop when it was determined that losing all of my content was for nothing they finally checked the device manager and discovered that no webcam drivers had been installed they then told me that i would have to pay to send the laptop back to them for repairs i refused to pay out anything more needless to say i will never purchase from acer again hard drive crashed after 7 months and it was going to cost more than the computer to fix product arrived on time and was as advertised no surprises nothing special about this recent buy no issues thus far appreciate the graphics card vs the newer model with the integrated card helps with some lighter games and other graphicsintensive apps horrible product bought it in march and it keeps disconnecting from the internet sound is absolutely horrible now i have a laptop that is absolutely useless it will not stay connected to wifi i constantly have to reconnect to wifi even after just a few minutes of inactivity everything is good for the price but the volume is to low l had to return and get an apple instead even though it is double the price this is a nice laptop for the price no issues so far at all i did need to take it out of s mode in order to install zoom which is basically mandatory these days the batter life is trash and heats up fast i bought this entry level acer as an extra to have around and was not expecting much for the price everything about this computer is very good except for the low volume of the sound i am not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume i was not expecting bose quality but i was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100 it is not here is what i did checked drivers opened the realtek to confirm all were set at 100 upon researching other reviews i noticed similar low volume issues it appears that this is where acer skimped i have an entry level toshiba that has horrible quality sound but it is loud i need to blutooth an external speaker just so i do not have to bring my ears to win 8 just to hear of course it does not help that acer put the speakers on the bottom yes the bottom of the unit it is a shame that acer did so much right for the price only to mess up on a incredibly low volume would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100 the answer to my rhetorical question is no but they did anywayoverall i would have given the unit 4 stars maybe even 5 but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3 at best unfortunatelymy takeaway is that i will not buy another acer without hearing the sound first built in camera and mic not working computer works well still trying to learn the operating system as it is different from the last computer worked fine for 13 months of occasional use and then out of nowhere the motherboard failedjust outside of the mfr warranty window piece of junk i absolutely love this laptop key board lights went out and i am a senior citizen with eye problems who runs a help line to get services for families trying to get moms into recovery and am limited in times i can help to day times when i can see the keys microsoft edge is the worst browser first off secondly this laptop did an automatic update and deleted several of my saved documents which are unrecoverable hours of work are lost it also blanked out 4x during a timed midterm exam last weeki have had this laptop for just 6 months sad to say i will not purchase acer again i purchased this product based on many reviews after waiting 30 minutes to set up this thing i called acer support this thing would not set up windows there is a 22 digit serial number that has to be provided fast and you have to use a telescope since the type is very small and is located no where near where the tech said it was am going on 3 hours now to fully set thing up and am about ready to send it back pure frustration this thing has all kinds of features but one important feature it lacks is the ability to set it up without having to take 3 hours of your life to do so recommend you buy something else overall its an ok computer but the speakers seems damaged its extremely low and there is a feedback computer works great just as advertised good value would buy again works exactly how i expected it to and does everything i need it to do a very good laptop for the price given i got this for gaming by day 3 the touch pad stopped working i troubleshooted it for days nothing worked it only works with a mouse i was very disappointed i returned this item and will buy a different brand really sucks because i liked it for gaming i have been very satisfied with this purchase so far i have only had it set up for less than a week so i cannot really state how well the battery is going to bebut so far it is great i have only had one small problem with setting up the email but i am just going on my web browser and accessing it from there not sure what the problem is probably something on my nonthechie side of the screen it is a great value for the money and i have absolutely no complaints the best feature i have found so far is the back lit keyboardi had no idea how wonderful this would beit is great i used to have to squint or turn on a light but not anymore it is really an amazing little labptop and the screen is crystal clear the speed is very fast and so far i am loving this laptop way more than the last 2 hewlett packards that i have had to replace due to faulty battery setting i love this computer works like a charm keyboard start to having pressing issue after a while specially the one you use most otherwise it is a great computer i bought this computer for a new full time remote position the computer is great for very basic needs only a couple tabs open and browsing the internet i needed to have 10 tabs open and be able to toggle back and forth very quickly for my role and this computer could unfortunately not keep up if you need something faster i would get the same computer but with an i5 processor for 200 more well worth the difference have had the new computer for a week and it runs remarkable faster and can keep up with what i need donealso i plugged in a bluetooth mouse to this computer and once i unplugged it i could not get the touch pad to work anymore so it is a good thing i am returning it as it also had this alternative issue backlit keyboard is nice but i hate to have to pay for word processing i hate this gortana which pops up all the time it is a cheaper computer that does its jobbut the mouse pad thing does not work anymore so i have to use a external mouse this has the potential to be a good computer but acer ships this in s mode windows 10 home cannot be activated running slui 4 will open the installation id but microsoft cannot activate that number the agent said i needed to call acer i called the tollfree number included with the computer and was told by that agent to call microsoft whodathunk or send it to acer to be repaired it was out of the box for ten minutes and they wanted it to be repaired thanks to amazon it is being returned run away i purchased this computer for my small business job within two weeks of use the down key came off amazons response is to glue the key down which is absurd you cannot just glue a key down which i explained but they said that is all that they could do they would not replace the computer i purchased this laptop for school social media youtube browsing i absolutley love it no complaints so far it is really good i actually got it two days earlier than they said they were going to send it to me which that is great not lasting more then 1hr and lagging when you unplug the cable still working on this hope to up my rating if we can get things working first experience with the system was very positive issue is that on day two i saw a message in the lower right corner of the screen go to settings to activate windows settings says we cannot activate windows on this device because you do not have a valid digital license or product key if you think you have a valid license or key select troubleshoot below troubleshooter says something interrupted our troubleshooting called acer support and was told they would mail me windows installation usb memory stick waited a little over one week and asked for status update was told that usb install media was not available and i should contact microsoft for activation entered last four digits from activation error message and was told i would need a new product key contacted acer support again and was told we would need to return the computer to the factory for fix which could take 1520 business days plus shipping time briefly considered returning to amazon be decided to try the acer service option will be awhile before we get it back the physical device is very nice lighted keyboard good except no indicators for caps lock nor num lock that is unfortunate what acer saved 2 to not include two little leds bluetooth nonoperating out of the box so will need to troubleshoot touchpad stopped functioning after a few weeks another thing to troubleshoot hope that is all the bad stuff that happens to this new machine we got this as a grad gift for our grandson great price great laptop fast delivery flimsy returned it finally unboxed this laptop have not used much but the charger that came with it is not original making me think it is a refurbished laptop advertised as new or sent a used one will update this review when i have used it a bitif i do not return it it very light weight but not very fast screen quality it is good purchased this for a high school kid does what it needs to do the base model is ok i like that you can upgrade this in the future they included the bracket for a secondary drive i will be buying more of these for clients works well for school wish i had read i to description more no sd card or disc reader so cost was not as well as i thought after buying external readers windows does not run as smoothly on the acer as it did on my dell my games do not work as well have to refresh page often when searching on internet not happy with this product cannot complain about an acer product for the price and quality i live everything about it except the battery lifei constantly has to recharge it to appoint i just kept it plugged most of the time a good performance to summarize you get what you pay for i was not expecting to run into so many problems right when i took this out of the box1 immediately i heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when i pulled it out of its packaging2 the sound is so bad it is like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store the speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality3 loud fan when it gets a little warm when using4 scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs i had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos i noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs5 customer service from both acer and amazon makes it difficult to fix yourmy issues i contacted customer service the same day after i received this laptop and also the day after after telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed6 possible restocking fee wanting to return this item even though i barely used it the first 2 days customer service told me that i cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it before they can tell me whether or not i will be charged a restocking fee if you do not like being surprised by restocking fees do not buy this laptop so you will not have to return7 i was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem basically to spend more money just so i can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file8 screen quality is definitely not good i would give it a 610 the color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor the difference is super noticeable9 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me you would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you are basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usablei know this has good reviews but do not be fooled by it i was swayed when i was going through the reviews but after i got my product i was highly disappointed i wish i had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop this one is not worth the regular price i would say with the issues and quality of this laptop the price should be around 250 works fine sound could be louder i tried 3 of them they perform differently from each other and they appeared to have different hardware suppliers internal parts made by random manufacturers for example m2 port is only pcie x2 speed and advertised internal sata3 port performs about 300mb write and 500mb read on a drive rated 530mb write 550mb readover it looks as if it was put together in a hurry debris around plastic body can easily can cut hands skin etc this laptop is great and i had it for months but when i first got it i had to pay another 100 dollars to take s mode off of it the computer itself is great for basic use checking email browsing the internet writing papers etc i bought it because i have a macbook and most department of defense websites are not compatible with mac os my biggest complaint is that 1 month into owning it the charging cable does not seem to work anymore and i am terrified for the day that the battery dies and i have no way of charging it after that not good as described not hapoy with battery performance it is a great laptop sometimes it can act a bit uppity but just restart it if you just installed some apps also it comes on s mode which you can change to regular windows 10 for free go in settings application switch to windows 10 mode good laptop but ended returning found one better cheap laptop you get what you pay for no hard drive no cd player mouse board difficult to control the product key on the laptop was bad and so i could not activate it acer customer support was horrible told me if i had bought it directly from them they could have given me a new product key but since i bought it from amazon i am pretty much on my own last time i buy this brand machine is a really great budget machine i got it for my wife for school but more than just a throw away machine in the standard form it was nothing great adding more ram woke it up a lot better overall performancethe backlit keyboard is huge plus for working at night screen resolution and clarity is great as well i had to return my laptop after the mouse cursor had mysteriously quit working after 3 days of use while i am used toto apple products i tried troubleshooting my windows laptop even tried restarting in safe mode to troubleshoot without resolve i even performed windows recovery still no resolve confused i thought that is okay i am within the allotted time to return my laptop so i requested a return and opted for a new replacement vs refund i was careful to ensure i remained in compliance with the return policy as set out by amazon and followed the instructions stepbystep i downloaded the ra and ups label provided and used it to return my laptop as instructed the following day i checked the amazon website for status of my return only to discover that all information about my return mysteriously disappeared i did not think much of it as more than a temporary technical error as it was admittedly nearing the deadline for return having carefully followed instructions per amazons return policy and with my proof of shipment receipt from ups i was confident it would work itself out nope evidently not more than two weeks later no replacement no refund no response no communication and four to five text messages later to the seller via amazon website along w submission of my proof of shipment receipt and tracking still no record of initiation or tracking of my return the history of my messages to amazon seller and my return request are also poof gonewhat the no phone numbers just the runaroundapparently i am now out 500 and a laptop fabulousknow the risk this laptop is 14 i am soooo angry this laptop is great its affordable and have a bunch of cool features the only issue is that it is extremely low you definitely need a headset or speakers i have to lift the device to my ears to hear if i do not have any of these available i have had it for a year and so far so good i love it easy to work with screen is small whole computer is really a tiny bit larger than a notebook but the processor is fast and all i thought i was upgrading but i have to wear glasses when using this thing to see the letters i have ordered four acer laptops from amazon in the last two years and love each and every one of them i thought it would be nice buy a fifth acer laptop after reading all the positive reviews on this one they were wrong and very misleading i should have paid attention to the negative reviews they were accurate this acer laptop was the worst sound system was terrible you can barely hear it even if you turn it up to the max the mouse pad and keys were unresponsive cannot adjust the settings etc i used it for a total of thirty minutes 30 minutes after i charged it and i put it right back in the packaging i could not get it out of my house fast enough within an hour i called amazon for return authorization to pick up the laptop the following day i got my full refund amazons excellent customer service saved the day greatly disappointed by this acer laptop buyer beware consover heatsspeakers are horrible can barely hear videos had to install an additional app to make sound loudercomputer lags a bit should not lag for the price of it not recommend for the priceprosgood quality when watching videos etc i like everything about this computer except the volumeyou can barely hear anything on it dislike the teeny hddlike i can throw an external drive on it and am gtg after taking it out of s modenear perfect for my needs and decent price not touchscreen as was advertised in the question and answer section the graphics are so so worse than my last acer overall 4 stars good computer i am using it to create elearningwhen i tried to remove the computer from windows s mode i realized that the computer did not come with a product key what this means is in order to remove s mode you have to buy windows home or pro and use the product key to remove s mode i wish they would have just told me that i contacted the company via amazon chat they said i needed to contact the manufacturer they gave me a phone number there is a button on amazon to contact the manufacturer as well no successi ended up just buying the downloadable windows home version and used the product key to remove s mode i also purchased the microsoft software for powerpoint word excel etcthat is a lot of drama just to be able to download things to my computer just know that you are buying a bare bones computer when you purchase was a great computer until i had used it twice for zoom and now the speakers no longer work if i figure out why i will update when i first received this laptop everything seemed great i was very excited to set it up with my personal information and get going i very quickly realized however that this computer was extremely slow for my tastes even with no background programs simple tasks like opening file explorer or a web browser took far too much time in my opinion a brand new computer should be opening programs almost instantly not leaving me waiting a few seconds or more this is ultimately preference but i am sure there are many more laptops out there for a similar price point that would run much faster returned this after only a day or so of having it and ended up with another laptop from the early 2010s and it runs much better than this one i had this laptop for about 2 months now and i am loving it so far it is lightweight sleek and the backlit keys are great for me in my dark room it boots up in seconds ready to go when you turn it on i mostly use this for watching videos and streams and excels it that the only negative that i can think of is the placement of the speakers the speakers are placed on the bottom and really muffle the sound so my volume is always at max other than that the laptop is a great budget buy displeased some black looks more like green dotted lines are running down the middle of my screen looks like some kind of defect the laptop was purchased at the start of september and did not see usage until about the 25th of september which means in about two months this situation happened was satisfied with my purchase before this occurrence i am not sure if it has touch screen poor quality cheap just like the price laptop is unlikely to last you long charging port was junkon the positive side it is very light and smallif you choose to purchase this laptop best of luck to you the battery died after a week and the screen started blinking i needed to connect an external monitor to work bad bad bad i was told i was going to get a new battery sent to me because every since i have the laptop it will only turn on if it is plugged in to the wall and i never received a new one very cheesy one keep freezing not able open files or photos not going waste my time to fight that i love this laptop the screen is a great size it is light weight not heavy and very sleek good laptop i do not do anything out of the ordinary does what a laptop is made to do i stayed with acer because my previous laptop was acer if it did not lose the w key function i would still be using it but would buy a new battery because unless it is plugged in it randomly shuts down bad battery so the new laptop had a new surprise the sound volume is very poor now lugging a wifi speaker along wherever the laptop goes i have to not recommend for this very reason absolute garbage i really do not write reviews but when i do i usually make them for the people this laptop is good when it works but i only used this about 10 times and now it does not charge or turn on pretty much got robbed i am really disappointed i was really hyped about this product but no durability whatsoever no scratch or anything looks brand new and it is a lemon buyers beware acer aspire 5 slim laptop 156 inches full hd computer stop working this month july 2021 i purchase this item in october 2020 as a christmas gift for my grandson unfortunately the computer has stop working and the battery will not charge please contact me in reference to the warranty information i would not purchase another computer through amazon no customer service support when needed bought

that it works only on microsoft edgesound quality is not clear and lowfinally the battery stopped charging and the laptop does not work except when it is plugged in power all of this happened after less than 8 months of usagea total waste of money the product arrived with a bad wireless card i returned the item and the refund was applied to a amazon gift card instead of my credit card i am not happy i have had this computer for a year and for some reason the computer will not work unless it is plugged in i originally got it for college but the pandemic caused me to stay and do school at home i have not spilled anything or dropped the computer so i do not know what the problem is nice pc but the backlighting went out after 3 weeks and acer could not help me having a laptop without being able to see the keys is not good bought one year ago already falling apart lacks durability good for a few months then you will need a new one the input to the power cord is broken and now the laptop will not charge the lever that opens and closes the laptop pulled apart stay away terrible quality i baught this laptop and after just a month and a half the mouse pad will not work scam all else ok i regret buying this laptop and spending all the extra money in shippingi am having two major troubles with this laptop1 the laptop slows down and lags badly once unplugged from power it runs fast and fine when plugged it is so bad i have gone to control panel and under power settings created a different profile for high performance and gone to advanced power settings and set everything to high performance and still the issue persistsi upgraded the ram to 16gb same issue i have done countless troubleshooting as seen on different websites my windows is updated i have switched off most background and startup apps and it is still same i just do not understand why i cannot have the freedom to use my laptop at high performance when unplugged this is crazy i am suspecting amd and acer to be behind this this issue sometimes does not happen but most times it does2 second issue is that when connected to hotspot this device will from time to time shut off internet connection for not obvious reasonso i could be in the middle of an important zoom meeting and off she goesdo not buy this if you want peace of mind the back cover also is inferior plastic considering i had a toshiba laptop for over 10 years with no problems i expected better of this but two months into it the touch pad and cursor died fortunately i still had the wireless mouse and keyboard so the laptop is still functionali do not have the time or patience to fool around with a return when i buy a product i expect it to work we will see how long it lasts track pad broke within 1 month of use amazon was no help extremely happy with this i have a laptop i can take on the go for long business trips even upgraded the ram to make it even better glad i found this  "
